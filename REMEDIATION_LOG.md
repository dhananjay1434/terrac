# TerraCipher dMRV — Remediation Log

Execution of `terracipher_reports/REMEDIATION_RUNBOOK_DETAILED.md`, one phase at a time,
with a mandatory gate per phase. Branch: `remediation/phase-by-phase`.

---

## Final — Phase 14 sign-off (2026-07-01)

**Phases complete:** 0–13 (runbook) + the re-audit hardening 7-R, 8-R, 9-R, 11-R, and the
`dev-token` critical R2. Every phase gated green with 0 new failures vs the Phase-0 baseline.

**Baseline → Final:**
| Suite | Phase-0 baseline | Final |
|---|---|---|
| Backend `pytest` | 120 passed, 2 failed (pre-existing), 1 skipped | **183 passed, 1 skipped, 1 failed** |
| Client `flutter test` | 144 passed, 2 skipped | **149 passed, 2 skipped** |
| `flutter analyze` | 34 issues (info/warn, 0 errors) | **34 issues (info/warn), 0 errors** |

`flutter analyze` count returned to the Phase-0 value of 34 (0 errors). Phase 6 had transiently reached
33; the Phase-14 `dart format` normalization of prior-session/throwaway test files (scratch/,
test_pragma.dart, test_quote.dart, legacy `test/` files) surfaced one additional **info-level** lint.
None are error-severity and none are in remediation-owned code.

The **2** Phase-0 pre-existing failures are now **1**: `test_migrations_gated` was incidentally fixed by
R2 (it failed on the removed `enrollment_tokens` seed query); the sole remaining failure,
`test_p0_21_hmac_secret`, is a documented import-isolation artifact, not a product defect.

**Sign-off checks (all green):**
- `ruff format --check backend` → 53 files already formatted (normalized in the Phase-14 `style:` commit).
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test` → no diffs.
- `flutter analyze` → **0 errors** (34 pre-existing info/warn, in throwaway/legacy files).
- Alembic `upgrade head → downgrade base → upgrade head` on isolated aiosqlite → clean; single linear head.

**Release sign-off checklist:**
- ✅ Ed25519 only; no `hmac_key` in identity/request code; no server path forges signatures.
- ✅ No `dev-token`, no `payload: dict`, no client-trusted `x-mock-location`, no fire-and-sleep sync,
  no fabricating defaults on credit fields; credit inputs corroborated server-side; lab H:Corg only via
  authenticated, range-checked channel; provisional batches are unsigned.
- ✅ Integrity & registration fail closed.
- ✅ Both suites green vs baseline; formatters clean; Alembic up/down clean.
- ⚠️ **One CRITICAL-OPEN item before minting real credits:** real platform-attestation verification
  (Play Integrity / DeviceCheck) is not implemented — enforcement is behind `server._ATTESTATION_ENFORCED`
  (default off). EXIF-based scene corroboration is best-effort (EXIF is forgeable). See FINDINGS_BACKLOG.

**Intended commit:** `chore: full regression green; remediation complete`

## Baseline (Phase 0) — 2026-06-30

### Backend — `cd backend && pytest -q`
**120 passed, 2 failed, 1 skipped** (run confirmed in-shell, 35.45s).

Known pre-existing failures (excluded from all later "no new failures" gates):
1. `tests/remediation/test_db_migrations.py::test_migrations_gated`
   — `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: enrollment_tokens`. Test-DB migration
   setup/ordering issue: `init_db()` queries `enrollment_tokens` before the table is created
   under the test harness. Not a product defect.
2. `tests/test_p0_21_hmac_secret.py::test_server_refuses_to_import_without_hmac_secret`
   — `DID NOT RAISE <RuntimeError>`. Test-isolation issue: `server` is already imported by the
   time the test pops it from `sys.modules`, so the import-time guard does not re-trigger.

### Client — `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` (clean re-run, 2026-06-30)
- `flutter test`: **144 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** ("All tests passed!").
- `flutter analyze`: **34 issues** — all info/warning severity (deprecations, unused imports,
  `avoid_print`); no errors. These are the pre-existing analyzer baseline.

The stale `.baseline_*.txt` from the prior session (paths full of `New folder\lib\...`, generated
before that duplicate tree was deleted) were overwritten by this clean run.

**Gate — GREEN.** Both suites run to completion; baseline counts recorded; pre-existing
failures listed. Branch created.

---

## Phase 1 — Backend import & structure hygiene  `[REFACTOR]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** `backend/server.py`. Behavior-preserving (imports hoisted; single module-level
`haversine_km`; `EnrollmentToken`/`CORG_TABLE` imported at top; in-function imports removed).

**Gate — GREEN**
- `python -m py_compile backend/server.py` → exit 0.
- `grep -n "^import json"` → 1 (line 14).
- `grep -c "    import "` (indented imports) → 0.
- `grep -c "def haversine("` → 0; `grep -c "def haversine_km("` → 1.
- `pytest -q` → 120 passed, 2 failed (both pre-existing), 1 skipped — **0 new failures**.

**Intended commit:** `refactor(backend): hoist imports and extract single haversine_km`

---

## Phase 2 — Dedicated admin secret  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/server.py`, `backend/.env.example`, `backend/tests/test_admin_secret.py` (new).

**Changes**
- `server.py`: added `_ADMIN_SECRET = os.environ.get("DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET")` block (hard
  `RuntimeError` if unset) directly after the `_HMAC_SECRET` block; changed `mint_enrollment_token`
  to `hmac.compare_digest(x_admin_secret, _ADMIN_SECRET)`. The HMAC pepper no longer doubles as
  the admin password.
- `.env.example`: added `DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET=` placeholder.
- `tests/test_admin_secret.py` (new): asserts the HMAC pepper is rejected as admin (401) and the
  dedicated admin secret is accepted (201), using the existing `client` fixture.

**Out-of-scope touch (disclosed, required by Appendix C — "required secret absent from env"):**
- `backend/tests/conftest.py`: added `os.environ.setdefault("DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET", "test-admin-secret")`
  — the exact parallel to the existing `DMRV_HMAC_SECRET` test shim. Without it, all backend tests
  fail at `import server` because of the new hard requirement. One line; no behavior change.

**Gate-command adaptation (this repo):** the runbook's `python -c "import server"` check also needs
`DATABASE_URL` set, because `db.py` enforces it at import (before `server`'s `load_dotenv()` runs).
Used the in-memory URL from conftest.

**Gate**
- `DMRV_HMAC_SECRET=x DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET=y DATABASE_URL=…memory python -c "import server"` → IMPORT_OK.
- Import WITHOUT `DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET` → correctly refuses with `DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET` RuntimeError.
- `pytest -q tests/test_admin_secret.py` → 2 passed.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **122 passed, 2 failed (both pre-existing), 1 skipped, 0 errors** —
  0 new failures. (122 = 120 baseline + 2 new admin tests.)
- `ruff format` → 3 files reformatted (server.py, conftest.py, test_admin_secret.py).

**Affected fixture (disclosed, out of listed scope — direct consequence of the fix):**
- `backend/tests/remediation/test_enrollment_auth.py`: its `admin_mint_token` fixture minted a
  token by sending the **HMAC pepper** as `X-Admin-Secret` (`"test-secret"`). Phase 2 correctly
  stopped the pepper from authenticating as admin, so the fixture started returning 401 and
  errored 3 dependent tests. Updated the fixture to send the dedicated admin secret
  (`"test-admin-secret"`). This is exactly the kind of fixture update the runbook anticipates
  (cf. Phase 7). Without it the Phase 2 gate could not stay green.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): use a dedicated DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET for admin auth`

---

## Phase 3 — Remove the `dev-token` backdoor  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/server.py` (`register_device`), `lib/services/crypto_signer.dart`
(registration only), `backend/tests/test_enrollment.py` (new).

**Changes**
- `server.py` `register_device`: removed the `if db_token.token != "dev-token":` special-case;
  the enrollment token is now consumed unconditionally (`db_token.used_at = datetime.now(...)`).
- `crypto_signer.dart` `registerDevice()`: removed the `defaultValue: 'dev-token'`; now
  `const enrollmentToken = String.fromEnvironment('ENROLLMENT_TOKEN')` with an `isEmpty` →
  `StateError` guard. (Per runbook, only the token line changed; `apiBaseUrl` is left for Phase 4.)
- `tests/test_enrollment.py` (new): minted token enrolls a device once (201); reuse → 401
  `enrollment_token_used`. Uses the `client` fixture.

**Gate**
- `grep -c '"dev-token"' backend/server.py` → 0.
- `grep -c "dev-token" lib/services/crypto_signer.dart` → 0.
- `pytest -q tests/test_enrollment.py` → 2 passed.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **124 passed, 2 failed (both pre-existing), 1 skipped, 0 errors** — 0 new
  failures (124 = 122 + 2 new).
- No Dart test calls `registerDevice`/`warmUp` (grep), so the client change is untested-path only.
- `flutter test` → **144 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** ("All tests passed!") — 0 new failures.
- Formatters: `ruff format` (1 file), `dart format` (crypto_signer.dart).

> **⚠ CRITICAL RESIDUAL (out of Phase 3 scope — logged in FINDINGS_BACKLOG):** `backend/db.py`
> `init_db()` (lines 55-66) still re-seeds a `dev-token` enrollment token and resets its
> `used_at = None` on every boot. The Phase 3 gate only greps `server.py`/`crypto_signer.dart`,
> so the backdoor survives in `db.py`. Must be removed in a dedicated step before release.

**Intended commit:** `fix: remove dev-token enrollment backdoor; require minted single-use tokens`

---

## Phase 4 — Client Ed25519 device identity  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/services/crypto_signer.dart`, callers in
`sync_queue_manager.dart` / `app_database.dart`, `test/services/crypto_signer_test.dart` (rewrite).

**Changes**
- `flutter pub add cryptography` → "Changed 1 dependency!" (pubspec.yaml + lock updated).
- `crypto_signer.dart`: replaced HMAC internals with **Ed25519** (runbook's exact code). The
  private seed never leaves the device; only the public key is enrolled. `registerDevice()` now
  sends `public_key` (not `hmac_key`) and requires both `ENROLLMENT_TOKEN` and `DMRV_API_BASE_URL`
  (no defaults). Public API preserved: `getDeviceId`, `signRequest`, `signPayload`, `clear`,
  `warmUp`, `resetForTest`, `resetKeyForTesting` — so `lib/` callers need **no** changes.
  Canonical signing string frozen: `method\npath\nidempotencyKey\nsha256(jsonBody)\ndeviceId`.
- `test/services/crypto_signer_test.dart` (rewrite): asserts Ed25519 determinism, that the signature
  changes when any canonical component changes, and that a public-key `verify` of a tampered body
  fails. → 3 passed.

**Affected test (disclosed, out of listed scope):**
- `test/crypto_signer_test.dart` (root): had `expect(sig1.length, 64)` — the exact 64-char-hex-HMAC
  assertion the runbook says "is now wrong and must be replaced". In THIS repo that assertion lives
  here, not in the services test. Replaced with an Ed25519 determinism check. (The file's other two
  cases — payload-changes, key-changes — remain valid and unchanged.) The other crypto-touching
  tests — `crypto_signer_keysizing_test.dart` (computes HMAC inline, never calls CryptoSigner),
  `hmac_outbox_test.dart` (asserts the `hmacSignature` column is non-empty — name unchanged),
  `sign_inside_transaction_test.dart` (static grep) — are unaffected by the HMAC→Ed25519 switch.

**Second affected test (disclosed, out of listed scope):**
- `test/device_integrity_test.dart`: asserted `signPayload`/`signRequest` throw `Exception`
  (`throwsException`) when the device is compromised. The runbook's new code throws
  `StateError('device_compromised')`, and in Dart `StateError` implements `Error`, not `Exception`
  — so the matcher failed. Updated both matchers to `throwsStateError` and the test name to match.
  (Confirmed no other test asserts the old compromise-Exception behavior.)

**Gate**
- `grep -c "hmac_key" lib/services/crypto_signer.dart` → 0.
- `flutter test test/services/crypto_signer_test.dart` → 3 passed.
- `flutter analyze` → **34 issues — identical to baseline, no new errors.**
- `flutter test` (full) → first run surfaced 1 new failure (device_integrity_test, above); after the
  fix: **146 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** — 0 new failures (146 = 144 baseline + 2 net-new crypto tests).
- `dart format` → applied (crypto_signer.dart + 3 test files).

**Note:** client now sends `public_key` + (still) `X-HMAC-Signature` header while the server still
verifies HMAC — client/server are intentionally mismatched until **Phase 5** lands the server-side
Ed25519 verifier and the `X-Signature` header rename (runbook: "4 & 5 land back-to-back").

**Intended commit:** `fix(client): replace symmetric HMAC identity with Ed25519 device signatures`

---

## Phase 5 — Server Ed25519 verification + column migration  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/models.py`, `backend/server.py`,
`backend/alembic/versions/<new>.py`, `backend/tests/test_signature.py` (new).

**State found at phase start:** the Phase 5 *implementation* was already present in the
working tree (applied by a prior session but never gated, logged, or committed — the log
stopped at Phase 4, and the Phase 4 note saying "server still verifies HMAC" was stale).
Verified in place:
- `models.py` — `DeviceKey.public_key` (was `hmac_key`).
- `server.py` — `verify_signature` uses `Ed25519PublicKey.from_public_bytes` + `_b64url_decode`;
  `RegistrationRequest.public_key`; all signed endpoints use `Depends(verify_signature)`;
  no `verify_hmac`/`hmac_key` references remain. Client already sends `X-Signature`.
- migration `d7e8f9a0b1c2_device_keys_hmac_to_public.py` — `batch_alter_table` rename
  `hmac_key`→`public_key`, with a working downgrade.
- `tests/test_signature.py` — 4 Ed25519 tests (accept / wrong-key reject / forge-from-pubkey
  reject / missing-sig 401).

**Work done this phase:** ran the Phase 5 gate. The implementation gate was already green;
the full-suite "no new failures" gate was **RED** with **6 new failures vs baseline**, all a
direct consequence of the HMAC→Ed25519 switch (Phases 4–5): legacy tests were still signing
requests with **HMAC** against the new Ed25519 verifier (→ `signature_mismatch`/`missing_signature`),
and one file tested the deliberately-removed HMAC verification path. Migrated them to Ed25519
using the existing `tests/remediation/crypto_utils.py` helper (`sign_canonical`, fixed test
keypair). **No assertion was weakened** — positive tests now sign with the enrolled key and still
assert acceptance; negative tests still assert rejection.

**Affected tests (disclosed, out of listed Phase-5 scope — direct consequence of the fix):**
- `tests/test_hmac_verification.py` — rewrote in place from the removed HMAC path to the Ed25519
  verifier (valid sig → auth passes; bad sig → 403 `signature_mismatch`; missing → 401). It used a
  mock device exposing `hmac_key` and asserted `detail=="hmac_mismatch"`, neither of which exists
  post-Phase-5. (The harness blocked deleting the pre-existing file; the rewrite is now misnamed —
  recommend renaming to `test_signature_verification.py`. Ed25519 coverage also lives in
  `test_signature.py`.)
- `tests/test_hardening.py` — `_sign` helper switched HMAC→`sign_canonical` (Ed25519). Keeps both
  `test_p1_19_*_accepted` (now 201) and `test_p1_19_*_replay_to_different_endpoint_rejected` green
  (the verifier rebuilds the canonical from the real request path, so a cross-endpoint replay
  still 403s).
- `tests/remediation/test_credit_gating.py::test_verified_batch_gets_credit` — inline
  `hmac.new(...)` → `sign_canonical(canonical)` (device enrolls `TEST_PUBLIC_KEY_B64`).
- `tests/remediation/test_enrollment_auth.py::test_registered_device_valid_signature_accepted` —
  enroll `TEST_PUBLIC_KEY_B64` + sign with `sign_canonical` (was enrolling an arbitrary key and
  HMAC-signing). Registration-only tests in the file keep the arbitrary `_B64_KEY` (they never
  verify a signature).
- `tests/test_p0_25_anchor.py::test_photo_then_batch_anchors_correctly` — inline
  `hmac.new(b"test-secret", ...)` → `sign_canonical(canonical)` for device `test-device-1`.

**Gate**
- `grep -nc "verify_hmac" backend/server.py` → 0.
- `grep -nc "hmac_key" backend/server.py backend/models.py` → 0.
- `alembic upgrade head` → baseline→`public_key`; `alembic downgrade -1` → `public_key`→`hmac_key`;
  `alembic upgrade head` → `public_key`. Verified via `PRAGMA table_info(device_keys)` at each step
  (isolated temp SQLite DB).
- `pytest -q tests/test_signature.py` → **4 passed**.
- `pytest -q` (full, `--timeout=60 --timeout-method=thread`) → **2 failed, 128 passed, 1 skipped** —
  the 2 failures are the documented Phase-0 pre-existing ones (`test_migrations_gated`,
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`); **0 new failures**. (131 total = 123 baseline + 2 admin + 2 enrollment
  + 4 signature.)
- `ruff format` on the 5 touched test files → reformatted (whitespace only; suite re-confirmed green
  before formatting).

**Residuals (logged, not in Phase-5 scope):**
- `server.py` CORS `allow_headers` still lists the dead `X-Hmac-Signature` and omits the live
  `X-Signature` — harmless for the mobile client (CORS is browser-only); clean up in a hygiene phase.
- Dead `import hmac` / `_RAW_KEY` now unused in the migrated test files (not gate-affecting).

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): verify Ed25519 device signatures; migrate device_keys to public_key`

---

## Phase 6 — Fail closed on integrity & registration  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `lib/services/device_integrity_service.dart`, `test/device_integrity_test.dart` (extend).

**What was wrong:** `initialize()` bypassed integrity whenever `kDebugMode || DMRV_DEMO_MODE`
with **no release guard** (a release built with `--dart-define=DMRV_DEMO_MODE=true` silently
disabled all root/emulator/hook detection); `signingCertHashes` defaulted to `['']` when the
env var was unset; and a `Talsec.start()` failure was swallowed with a "this is normal" log —
all fail-OPEN paths in an anti-fraud control.

**Changes (`device_integrity_service.dart` `initialize()`):**
- `DMRV_DEMO_MODE && kReleaseMode` → `throw StateError('DMRV_DEMO_MODE is forbidden in release builds.')`.
- demo/debug (non-release) → explicit skip with a log, as before.
- Release with empty `TALSEC_SIGNING_CERT_HASH` or `TALSEC_IOS_TEAM_ID` → `_compromised('Integrity configuration missing')` (fail closed) instead of building a `['']` config.
- `TalsecConfig(..., isProd: true)` (was `isProd: !kDebugMode`, unreachable in the release path anyway), real cert hash / team id wired in.
- `Talsec.start()` failure → `_compromised('Talsec failed to start: $e')` (fail closed), not a swallowed debugPrint. Dropped the unused `st` binding.

**Test (`test/device_integrity_test.dart`, extended):** kept the existing compromise-signing test and added
(1) a behavioral test that `initialize()` is a no-op in debug/test mode and does NOT flip the compromised
flag, and (2) a source-guard test that locks in the three fail-closed markers (`forbidden in release builds`,
`Integrity configuration missing`, `Talsec failed to start:`, `isProd: true`) and asserts `isProd: !kDebugMode`
is gone. The release/throw paths can't be exercised under `flutter test` (kReleaseMode is always false there),
so the source-guard test is the durable lock — same style as the repo's existing
`device_integrity_enforcement_test.dart::placeholder_cert_hash_absent`.

**Gate**
- `grep -n "forbidden in release builds" lib/services/device_integrity_service.dart` → present (line 18).
- `flutter analyze` → **33 issues** — all pre-existing info/warnings, **no errors, no new issues** (one fewer
  than the 34 baseline: the new `catch (e)` removed an unused-variable warning).
- `flutter test test/device_integrity_test.dart` → **3 passed**.
- `flutter test` (full) → **148 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** ("All tests passed!") — 0 new failures
  (148 = 146 baseline + 2 net-new integrity tests).
- `dart format` applied to both touched files.

**Intended commit:** `fix(client): fail closed on integrity bypass, missing config, and registration errors`

---

## Phase 7 — Require credit-bearing inputs  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/server.py` (`BatchPayload`), affected fixtures in `backend/tests/`.

**What was wrong:** `wet_yield_kg` defaulted to `100.0`, `min_recorded_temp_c`/`transport_distance_km`
to `0.0`. These three feed the LCA credit calculation, so an omitted field silently fabricated a
credit for never-measured data.

**Changes (`server.py` `BatchPayload`):** all three defaults → required.
- `wet_yield_kg: float = Field(..., gt=0.0, ...)`
- `min_recorded_temp_c: float = Field(..., ge=-50.0, le=1500.0, ...)`
- `transport_distance_km: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=20000.0, ...)`

**Test (`backend/tests/test_required_credit_inputs.py`, new):** parametrized over the three fields —
posting a batch with any one omitted returns **422** and the response cites the missing field
(signed via the conftest Ed25519 auto-signer, so the 422 is the validation layer, not auth).

**Fixtures:** none required updating — the full suite ran with **0 new failures**, confirming every
existing batch test already supplies the three fields (e.g. `_valid_payload` in `test_hardening.py`).
Nothing to disclose here.

**Gate**
- `grep -n "wet_yield_kg: float = Field(\.\.\." backend/server.py` → present (line 143).
- `pytest -q tests/test_required_credit_inputs.py` → **3 passed**.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **2 failed, 131 passed, 1 skipped** — the 2 failures are the documented
  Phase-0 pre-existing ones; **0 new failures** (131 = 128 + 3 new Phase-7 tests).
- `ruff format` applied to `server.py` and the new test.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): make wet_yield_kg, min_temp, transport_distance required`

---

## Phase 13 — Correct overstated claims & residual doc rot  `[REFACTOR]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `lib/main.dart`, `lib/services/secure_capture_service.dart`,
`lib/data/local/tables.dart` (header), `lib/data/local/proof_queries.dart`; plus the CORS
`allow_headers` hygiene folded in from Phases 5/9 residuals.

**What was wrong:** marketing/overstated claims and stale docs — `main.dart` claimed connectivity "can
never cause double-counted carbon credits"; `secure_capture_service.dart` called the SHA-256 an
"indelible digital fingerprint" (conflating file integrity with scene authenticity); `tables.dart`
header said "(v4)" while `schemaVersion` is 15; `proof_queries.dart:89` had an empty `catch (_) {}`; and
CORS `allow_headers` still advertised the dead `X-Hmac-Signature` and omitted the live `X-Signature`.

**Changes**
- `main.dart`: reworded to "an append-only outbox with per-operation idempotency keys **minimizes**
  double-counting … a mitigation, not an absolute guarantee; issuance integrity is enforced server-side
  (corroboration + PROVISIONAL gating)." Dropped the "Truth Machine" label.
- `secure_capture_service.dart`: SHA-256 reworded to "transit tamper-evidence anchor … does NOT prove
  the photo depicts a real burn; scene authenticity is corroborated server-side via EXIF GPS (Phase 9)."
- `tables.dart` header: `(v4)` → `(schemaVersion = 15)`, points to `AppDatabase.schemaVersion`, notes
  v5/v13/v14 have no dedicated block, and lists the real v2→v15 migration history.
- `proof_queries.dart`: empty `catch (_) {}` on `smokeEvidenceJson` parse → `catch (e)` that logs via
  `debugPrint` and degrades to no smoke proofs (added `package:flutter/foundation.dart` import).
- `server.py` CORS `allow_headers`: dropped dead legacy HMAC header; added live `X-Signature`,
  `X-Enrollment-Token`, `X-Admin-Secret`.

**Gate**
- `grep -rc "indelible" lib` → 0; `grep -c "catch (_) {}" proof_queries.dart` → 0;
  `grep -c "X-Hmac-Signature" server.py` → 0.
- `flutter analyze` → **33 issues** — identical to baseline, no new.
- `flutter test` (full) → **149 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** — 0 new failures. `python -m py_compile server.py` OK.
- `dart format` (4 files) + `ruff format` (server.py) applied.

**Intended commit:** `docs(client): correct integrity-vs-authenticity claims and schema header; cors: advertise live headers`

---

## Phase 17 — Batch-ownership authorization on the evidence endpoints  `[SECURITY]`  ✅ DONE

**Finding (CRITICAL, from the post-C4 deep review):** the six evidence endpoints
(`/telemetry`, `/yield`, `/moisture`, `/application`, `/metadata`, `/composite-sample`) took
`device_id = Depends(verify_signature)` — i.e. they authenticated the caller — but never used it.
None checked that the caller **owns** the batch the evidence anchors to. Because the carbon credit is
corroborated server-side from these streams (`recompute_batch_credit`), any *enrolled* device could
inject telemetry/yield/application/moisture/composite rows into another device's batch and move its
credit. This was authorization, not authentication: identity was proven, ownership was not. The media
endpoint already did this check (`not_your_batch`, Phase 15-A); the JSON evidence channels did not, and
C4 widened the surface by one more channel.

**Fix:** one shared guard `_assert_batch_ownership(session, batch_uuid, device_id)`, called as the
FIRST statement of every evidence handler (before any `session.add`), mirroring the media rule:
  * batch exists + owned by another device → **403 `not_your_batch`** (the hole)
  * batch exists + owned by this device / owner NULL → OK
  * batch does not exist yet → OK (evidence-first is a legitimate flow; `create_batch` establishes
    ownership from its own signed payload when it arrives, and drives the authoritative recompute then)
  * malformed batch_uuid → passes through to the handler's own persistence/validation (cannot match an
    owned batch, so not a bypass)

No schema change; no client change (the honest client always signs as the batch owner, so the guard is
transparent to it — proven by the full suite passing unchanged).

**Tests:** `test_batch_ownership.py` — (1) a different enrolled device is 403'd on ALL SIX endpoints AND
no row is persisted; (2) the owner posts to all six and gets 201; (3) evidence-first for an absent batch
is still accepted on all six.

**Gate:** backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 215 passed, 1 skipped** (+3 new tests; the 1 failure is the
pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret` env artifact; **0 new failures**). No Flutter change (server-only).
`ruff format` applied.

**Follow-ups (unchanged by this phase, still open):** the one-to-one evidence tables (`telemetry`/
`yield`/`application`) silently return `{"duplicate": true}` on the first-writer-wins IntegrityError —
now that a foreign device is blocked *before* the insert, the residual risk is a legitimate owner's
correction being dropped; consider upsert like `/metadata`. And same-device self-corroboration limits
still apply (see the C6 transport cross-check + attestation TODO).

**Intended commit:** `fix(security): enforce batch ownership on all evidence endpoints (not_your_batch)`

---

## Phase 17b — Upsert one-to-one evidence corrections (no silent drop)  `[INTEGRITY]`  ✅ DONE

**Finding (the follow-up deferred from Phase 17):** `telemetry` / `yield` / `application` each have BOTH
`<x>_uuid` AND `batch_uuid` UNIQUE. Their handlers caught *every* IntegrityError and returned
`{"duplicate": true}`. So a legitimate **correction** — a resubmission for the same batch under a new
`<x>_uuid` (e.g. a re-weighed yield) — collided on `batch_uuid` and was **silently dropped**: the batch
kept the first (stale, or in the pre-Phase-17 threat model attacker-injected) value and the corrected
one was lost, with a success response. The credit never re-derived. `/metadata` already upserted; these
three did not.

**Fix:** shared `_upsert_one_to_one_evidence(session, model, uuid_attr, uuid_value, batch_uuid,
payload_json)`, called on IntegrityError by all three handlers. It discriminates the two collision
sources (only possible now because both keys are unique):
  * same `<x>_uuid` again → genuine idempotent retry → `{"duplicate": true}` (no-op).
  * different `<x>_uuid`, same `batch_uuid` → **correction → UPDATE the row in place** (overwrite the
    natural key + payload), commit, and `_recompute_if_batch_exists` so the credit re-derives →
    `{"updated": true}`.
  * `<x>_uuid` collides against a row on a *different* batch (pathological UUID reuse) → no batch row to
    upsert → `{"duplicate": true}` (do not clobber another batch's record).
Complements Phase 17: the foreign device is already rejected *before* the insert, so this closes the
residual risk of an honest owner's correction being swallowed.

**Tests:** `test_evidence_upsert.py` — same-uuid retry stays `duplicate`; a correction under a new uuid
returns `updated`, leaves exactly ONE row carrying the new value, and (for yield) the batch's
`wet_yield_kg` credit input actually changes 100→250 (pre-fix it stayed 100).

**Gate:** backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 219 passed, 1 skipped** (+4 new tests; the 1 failure is the
pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**). Server-only. `ruff format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(integrity): upsert one-to-one evidence corrections instead of silently dropping them`

---

## Phase C10 — Rainbow compliance: unified issuance gate + compliance report  `[CAPSTONE]`  ✅ DONE

**Goal:** fold every previously-inert methodology reason into ONE issuance gate and expose a
per-batch compliance report. This phase FLIPS ENFORCEMENT ON — batches that were non-provisional under
the weaker gate correctly become provisional until their methodology data is complete. Server-only.

**Enforcement switch:** `corroboration.COMPLIANCE_ENFORCED = True`. C4 (composite) and C5
(delivery/buyer) derivers now default to enforced; new derivers added for C1 (biomass), C8 (kiln
registration, scale calibration), C9 (annual methane, PAH). Each deriver keeps an `enforced` override so
a caller/test can opt out.

**Now ENFORCED (resolvable from batch state):**
- C1 `missing_biomass_input` / `missing_conversion_factor` (batch biomass fields).
- C4 `missing_composite_sample` (photographed sub-sample).
- C5 `missing_delivery_record` / `missing_buyer_identity` (application payload).
- C8 `unregistered_kiln` — batch telemetry `kiln_id` must exist in `kilns`; inert when no kiln_id.

**Deliberately DORMANT (documented follow-up, NOT faked):** `scale_calibration_expired` and
`missing_annual_methane`/`missing_pah` require a batch→project/scale linkage that does not exist on the
Batch model yet. Enforcing them now would gate EVERY batch unconditionally (no way to resolve the right
calibration/verification row). The derivers exist + are unit-tested; wiring waits on a future phase that
adds `batch.project_id` / `scale_id`. `derive_pah_compliance` is called with `enforced=False` in
recompute for the same reason.

**Also NOT in C10 (separate credit-math phases, need methodology sign-off):** flip C6
`TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED` + wire fuel emissions into the LCA; feed C9 methane rate into
`step7_ch4_penalty`; feed C9 `conversion_factor` into C1 yield_conversion; enable the C7 1000-yr
inertinite pathway. C10 is methodology COMPLETENESS, not credit-math.

**Changes**
- `corroboration.py`: `COMPLIANCE_ENFORCED`, `MIN_METHANE_RUNS`; new derivers
  `derive_biomass_compliance`, `derive_kiln_registration_compliance`, `derive_scale_calibration_compliance`,
  `derive_annual_methane_compliance`, `derive_pah_compliance`; `assemble(..., extra_reasons=[])` appends
  caller-derived gate reasons (de-duped, ordered).
- `server.recompute_batch_credit`: computes C1/C8 (+dormant C9-PAH) gate signals, passes `extra_reasons`.
- `GET /api/v1/batches/{uuid}/compliance` (admin): returns `provisional` / `issuable` / ordered `reasons`
  + a human `checklist` from `_COMPLIANCE_CATALOG` (every reason → methodology section + label).

**Stale-test triage (the enforcement flip, handled deliberately — never weakened the gate):** 7 tests
encoded the old inert behavior. Fixed each to the correct new invariant: the two `deriver_inert_by_default`
unit tests now assert the `enforced=False` OPT-OUT; the C8 "registry does not gate" test became
`unregistered_kiln`-gates-and-registration-clears-it; the lab/provisional helpers
(`test_lab_hcorg_channel`, `test_lca_provisional`) now supply the full C1/C4/C5 set so a fully-complete
batch genuinely reaches issuable; `test_corroboration_flow` (a physical-convergence test) now asserts the
physical reasons cleared rather than pinning the whole list.

**Tests:** `test_compliance_gate_c10.py` — a fully-populated batch is issuable (empty reasons); each of
biomass / composite / delivery / unregistered-kiln toggled off surfaces its exact reason; the compliance
endpoint returns the checklist (missing item not-ok, satisfied item ok); admin-required (401); unknown
batch 404.

**Gate:** backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 260 passed, 1 skipped** (+8 C10 tests, 7 stale tests updated;
the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**); `flutter analyze` 25 /
0 errors; `flutter test` unchanged (server-only); `ruff format` applied. **No client migration.**

**Rainbow Compliance — status:** C0–C10 complete. Every methodology line either enforces a provisional
reason today or is a documented, tracked follow-up (project/scale linkage; the four credit-math flips).

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): unified issuance compliance gate + /compliance report (Rainbow C10)`

---

## Phase C9 — Rainbow compliance: annual verification inputs (admin)  `[V][ADMIN]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement (annually / when feedstock changes; + per verification):** methane emission rate (3
representative runs, independent provider), PAH / heavy-metals composite (PAH mandatory closed-kiln),
biomass→biochar conversion factor, updated biomass leakage assessment, dry bulk density per site, and the
per-verification quality-oversight report. Project-level, admin-authenticated. **Server-only, no client
change.**

**Scope decision (agreed, mirrors C6/C8):** DATA CAPTURE only. The credit-affecting fields are captured
but **NOT wired into the credit** here — the measured methane rate could replace the temperature-heuristic
CH4 penalty (`step7_ch4_penalty`) and the `conversion_factor` feeds C1's `yield_conversion` method; both
need methodology sign-off and their own gated phase (same discipline as C6 transport emissions). The
compliance reasons (`missing_annual_methane`, `missing_pah`) are deferred to the C10 unified gate. A test
asserts recording an annual verification changes no batch's provisional status.

**Changes**
- Model + Alembic `e1f2a3b4c5d6`: one `annual_verifications` table keyed by a UNIQUE `(project_id, year)`
  — methane_rate_g_per_kg / methane_run_count / conversion_factor / pah_measured /
  heavy_metals_measured / leakage_assessment_done / dry_bulk_density / quality_oversight_sha256 /
  report_sha256 (+ payload_json). Report artifacts via the signed `/media` channel.
- Server: `POST /api/v1/admin/annual-verification` (admin-auth via `_require_admin`), **upsert on
  (project_id, year)** → `{updated: bool}` — the methodology captures these annually / when feedstock
  changes, so a re-POST updates the year's record. Strict `AnnualVerificationRequest` (range-checked:
  year 2000–2100, conversion_factor > 0, etc.).

**Tests:** `test_annual_verification_c9.py` — admin-required (401); register-then-update is an upsert (one
row, latest values); distinct years are separate rows; range checks (conversion_factor > 0, year bounds →
422); recording a verification does NOT gate any batch (reasons deferred to C10).

**Gate:** Alembic `up→down base→up` clean (aiosqlite); backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 251 passed,
1 skipped** (+5 new; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**);
`flutter analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` unchanged (server-only); `ruff format` applied. **No client
migration.**

**Follow-ups (C10 + a dedicated credit phase):** wire `missing_annual_methane` (no current-period methane
record) and `missing_pah` (closed-kiln batch in a period lacking PAH) into the C10 gate; and — with
methodology sign-off — feed the measured methane rate into the CH4 penalty and the conversion factor into
C1 yield_conversion (credit-math change, own gated phase, like the C6 `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED` flip).

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): annual verification inputs — methane/PAH/leakage/conversion (Rainbow C9)`

---

## Phase C8 — Rainbow compliance: project registry (admin console)  `[ADMIN]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement (project setup, once / updated on change):** infrastructure & machinery data (kiln
material, weight, item lifetime), kiln-operator training records, kiln-supervisor site-visit reports,
scale-calibration proof. Project-level, admin-authenticated — a project console, **NOT** the per-run field
app. **Server-only, no client change.**

**Scope decision (agreed):** C8 lands the REGISTRY (4 tables + admin endpoints) only. The compliance
reasons it enables — `unregistered_kiln`, `scale_calibration_expired` — are **deferred to the C10 unified
gate** (inert-by-default, like C1/C4/C5), so no batch's issuance changes in C8. A test asserts a batch
whose telemetry `kiln_id` is unregistered is unaffected.

**Changes**
- Models + Alembic `d0e1f2a3b4c5` (4 tables): `kilns` (kiln_id unique; material/weight/lifetime/type +
  payload_json — upsert on change), `operator_training` (record_uuid unique, many per project),
  `supervisor_visits` (visit_uuid unique; report_sha256 → reuse the signed `/media` channel for the
  artifact), `scale_calibrations` (calibration_uuid unique; `calibrated_at` / `valid_until` parsed to real
  DateTime columns so the C10 gate can check in-date calibration).
- Server (4 admin endpoints, `X-Admin-Secret` via a new `_require_admin` helper): `POST /admin/kiln`
  (upsert by kiln_id → `{updated: bool}`), `POST /admin/operator-training`, `POST /admin/supervisor-visit`,
  `POST /admin/scale-calibration` (one-to-many, IntegrityError→`{duplicate: true}`). New `_parse_dt`
  rejects a malformed timestamp with 400 (not 500).

**Tests:** `test_project_registry_c8.py` — all four require admin (401 on wrong secret, parametrized);
kiln register-then-update is an upsert (one row, latest values); operator-training persists + dedupes;
supervisor-visit round-trips report_sha256; scale-calibration parses the validity window; bad timestamp →
400; a batch with an unregistered kiln_id gains NO C8 reason (registry is inert until C10).

**Gate:** Alembic `up→down base→up` clean (aiosqlite); backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 246 passed,
1 skipped** (+10 new; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**);
`flutter analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` unchanged (server-only); `ruff format` applied. **No client
migration.**

**Follow-up (C10):** wire `unregistered_kiln` (batch telemetry kiln_id ∈ kilns) and
`scale_calibration_expired` (an in-date scale_calibrations row) into the unified issuance gate; enable the
1000-yr inertinite pathway election (C7 data-capture) as a project setting here/at C8-project level.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): project registry — kilns/training/visits/scale calibration (Rainbow C8)`

---

## Phase C7 — Rainbow compliance: per-batch lab results (admin channel)  `[V]` ⚠ TOUCHES CREDIT MATH  ✅ DONE

**Requirement `[V]`:** per-batch lab data — organic **Corg** (elemental), **H:Corg**, biochar moisture
(≥3 samples), dry bulk density, inertinite + residual Corg (1000-yr pathway, ≥500 Ro). `[V]` = verification
only → **admin-authenticated, never device-asserted** (same discipline as Phase 8-R `ingest_lab_hcorg`).
**No client change** (lab data never comes from the device).

**Integrity fix (the point of C7):** organic **Corg was a hardcoded species CONSTANT** (`lca_engine.CORG_TABLE`)
— the same class of self-asserted assumption the H:Corg channel already closed. C7 makes a lab-measured
Corg authoritative and PREFERRED in the credit; its absence keeps the batch provisional via a new
`assumed_corg` reason (mirroring `assumed_h_corg`).

**Changes**
- LCA (`lca_engine.py`): `calculate_carbon_credit(..., corg_override=None)` — when supplied it REPLACES
  the `get_corg(species)` constant; `LCAAudit.corg_assumed` records which was used (True = species constant).
- Corroboration: `assemble(..., has_lab_corg=True)` → `assumed_corg` reason. Default True so pure callers
  are unaffected; `recompute_batch_credit` passes `effective_corg is not None`.
- Server: `recompute_batch_credit(..., lab_corg=None)` threads Corg through (prefers arg, else
  `batch.organic_carbon_pct`), passes `corg_override` to the LCA, and folds `lca.corg_assumed` into
  `batch.provisional`. New `POST /api/v1/admin/lab` (admin-auth) accepting `LabResultsRequest`
  (lab_h_corg, organic_carbon_pct (0,1], biochar_moisture_samples min 3, dry_bulk_density, inertinite_pct,
  residual_corg_pct, ro_measurements_count — all range-checked). `/admin/lab-hcorg` kept as-is
  (back-compat). Persists the verification fields on `Batch`.
- Model + Alembic `c9d0e1f2a3b4`: nullable `organic_carbon_pct`, `biochar_moisture_samples_json`,
  `dry_bulk_density`, `inertinite_pct`, `residual_corg_pct`, `ro_measurements_count` on `batches`, plus a
  DB CHECK `organic_carbon_pct IN (0, 1]` (mirrors the lab_h_corg guard; added via `batch_alter_table` for
  SQLite compat). 1000-yr inertinite pathway is DATA-CAPTURE ONLY here — the alternate permanence pathway
  is a project election gated to C8.

**Invariant change (intended, breaking for two old tests):** a fully-issuable (non-provisional) credit
now requires BOTH lab H:Corg AND lab Corg. Two Phase-8-R tests asserted H:Corg-alone cleared provisional;
updated to the C7 invariant (H:Corg-alone leaves exactly `assumed_corg`; the full `/admin/lab` with both
clears it). `test_corroboration_flow` fully-corroborated reasons updated `["assumed_h_corg"]` →
`["assumed_h_corg","assumed_corg"]`. These were caught by the gate, diagnosed, and updated deliberately —
not worked around.

**Tests:** `test_lab_results_c7.py` — corg_override replaces the constant + changes the credit
(`corg_assumed` flips); `/admin/lab` clears `assumed_corg` and recomputes; persists the verification
fields; admin-required (401); range checks (Corg>1 → 422, <3 moisture samples → 422); unknown batch 404.
Plus the two updated invariant tests + the new full-channel issuance test.

**Gate:** Alembic `up→down base→up` clean (aiosqlite); backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 236 passed,
1 skipped** (+7 net new; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**);
`flutter analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` unchanged (server-only phase); `ruff format` applied.
**No client migration** (server-only).

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): per-batch lab results channel; lab Corg replaces species constant (Rainbow C7)`

---

## Phase C6 — Rainbow compliance: transport events  `[COMPLIANCE]` ⚠ TOUCHES CREDIT MATH  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** per transport event — **distance, weight, vehicle type, fuel consumed**, separately for
**biomass** and **biochar**. New one-to-many channel. Additive.

**Landing decision (credit-safety):** the Rainbow methodology annexes provide **no numeric fuel emission
factors** (the doc lists only the required per-event data). Per the C6 rule we do NOT invent factors.
So this phase lands the FULL data channel + emissions plumbing but keeps it **AUDIT-ONLY** — it adds
**zero movement to any issued credit**:
  * `emission_factors.py` — the single audited factor module, every constant marked `TODO(cite)` and
    `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED = False`. `fuel_emissions_kg_co2e(fuel_type, litres)` is the pure per-leg
    math (unknown fuel → most-conservative/highest known factor).
  * `recompute_batch_credit` sums per-leg fuel emissions and runs a GPS-vs-reported **under-reporting
    cross-check** (reported legs < 50% of the production→application haversine → flag). Both are written
    to `lca_audit_json.transport_events` (event_count / fuel_co2e_kg / reported_km / gps_km /
    underreported_flag). The GPS-haversine transport penalty in the LCA stays authoritative; the credit
    and the issuance HMAC signature (which signs only the LCA dataclass) are unchanged. The cross-check
    flag is deliberately NOT added to `provisional_reasons` — it is a review signal, not an issuance gate.

**Changes**
- Client: new Drift table `TransportEvents` (`eventUuid` unique, `batchUuid` FK/indexed, `material`
  'biomass'|'biochar', distance/weight/vehicle/fuel/amount, occurredAt). `schemaVersion` 21→22; additive
  `createTable` migration; header v22. Writer `insertTransportEventWithOutbox`; `kEndpointByTable` adds
  `transport_events → transport`; added to `secureWipe`. `.g.dart` regenerated.
- Server: `TransportEvent` model (`event_uuid` unique, `batch_uuid` indexed — many per batch); Alembic
  `b8c9d0e1f2a3` (down_revision `a7b8c9d0e1f2`). Strict `TransportEventPayload` + signed,
  ownership-guarded `POST /api/v1/transport` (dedupe on IntegrityError, like moisture/composite).

**Tests:** `test_transport_events_flow.py` — fuel-emissions unit (zero when amount missing; scales with
litres; unknown fuel conservative); **guard test that `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED is False`**; many-per-batch
persist + audit block populated; **credit does NOT change** when a 100 L leg is added; under-reporting
raises the audit flag but does NOT appear in provisional_reasons. Client
`migration_v22_c6_transport_test.dart` locks the v22 table shape.

**Gate:** Alembic `up→down base→up` clean (aiosqlite); codegen exit 0; backend `pytest` → **1 failed,
229 passed, 1 skipped** (+6 new; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new
failures** — notably NO LCA/corroboration test moved, confirming the credit math is untouched); `flutter
analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` **151 passed, 2 skipped**; `ruff`+`dart format` applied.

**Drive-by fix:** the C5 `migration_v21_c5_delivery_test.dart` pinned `expect(schemaVersion, 21)`, which
this phase's bump to 22 broke (schemaVersion is a single latest-version global). Changed both v21/v22
schema-shape tests to `greaterThanOrEqualTo(...)` so they assert the columns/table exist, not a version
number, and removed an unused import. Caught by the gate before commit.

**FOLLOW-UP (open):** cite the real Rainbow fuel emission factors in `emission_factors.py`, get
methodology-owner sign-off, then flip `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED = True` and wire the summed emissions
into the LCA (replacing/augmenting the GPS-haversine penalty). That flip is a deliberate credit-math
change and needs its own gated phase + LCA test review.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): transport-event evidence channel + audit-only emissions/cross-check (Rainbow C6)`

---

## Phase C5 — Rainbow compliance: delivery records + buyer identity  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** delivery tracking (date, amount, batch id) + **buyer/end-user name + contact**. Additive;
extends the EXISTING `end_use_application` — **no new table, no server migration** (fields live in the
application `payload_json`, which `recompute_batch_credit` already loads).

**Changes**
- Client `EndUseApplication`: nullable `deliveryDate`, `deliveredAmountKg`, `buyerName`, `buyerContact`.
  `schemaVersion` 20→21; additive `if (from<21)` `addColumn` migration; header v21. Writer
  `insertEndUseWithOutbox` gains the four optional params (companion + payload). `.g.dart` regenerated.
  PII note: buyer name/contact live only in the SQLCipher DB and are already covered by `secureWipe`
  (end_use_application was already in the wipe set — verified, no change needed).
- Server `ApplicationPayload`: optional, length/range-bounded `delivery_date` (≤64), `delivered_amount_kg`
  (`ge=0,le=100000`), `buyer_name`/`buyer_contact` (≤256). Persisted in payload_json.
- Compliance (pure, `corroboration.py`): `derive_delivery_compliance(app_payload, *, enforced=False)` →
  `(delivery_ok, buyer_ok)`; delivery_ok = a delivery date OR amount present; buyer_ok = non-blank buyer
  name. **Inert by default** (deferred to the C10 unified gate, mirroring C4/C1) so existing flows are
  untouched. `assemble` gains `delivery_ok`/`buyer_ok` → reasons `missing_delivery_record` /
  `missing_buyer_identity`. Wired into `recompute_batch_credit` from the already-loaded `app_payload`.

**Tests:** `test_delivery_buyer_flow.py` — deriver inert by default; enforced flags each missing piece
(amount-only, whitespace buyer, both present); endpoint round-trips buyer/delivery into payload_json and
stays non-gating; over-length `buyer_contact` → 422. Client `migration_v21_c5_delivery_test.dart` locks
the v21 schema shape (new columns exist + accept the fields).

**Gate:** codegen exit 0 (C5 fields generated); backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 223 passed, 1 skipped**
(+4 new; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**); `flutter
analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` **150 passed, 2 skipped** (149 + the new v21 test); `ruff`+`dart
format` applied. No server migration (client migration v21 only).

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): delivery records + buyer identity on end-use application (Rainbow C5)`

---

## Phase C4 — Rainbow compliance: site composite pile sub-sample  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** a biochar sub-sample set aside per run, tagged with **date/time, GPS, kiln ID/QR,
batch ID/QR** and **photographed**. New evidence channel (many sub-samples per batch). Additive; new
table on both client and server.

**Changes**
- Client: new Drift table `CompositePileSamples` (`sampleUuid` unique, `batchUuid` FK/indexed,
  `sampledAt`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `kilnQr`, `batchQr`, `sandboxPath`, `sha256Hash`, `createdAt`).
  Registered in `@DriftDatabase`; `schemaVersion` 19→20; additive `if (from<20)` `createTable` migration;
  header v20. Writer `insertCompositePileSampleWithOutbox` (photo rides the existing signed two-phase
  `/media` path). `kEndpointByTable` adds `composite_pile_samples → composite-sample`. `.g.dart`
  regenerated (`$CompositePileSamplesTable` present). Also added `moistureReadings` (C2, pre-existing
  gap) **and** `compositePileSamples` to `secureWipe` so their PII/GPS is scrubbed.
- Server: `CompositePileSample` model (`sample_uuid` unique, `batch_uuid` indexed — many per batch);
  Alembic `a7b8c9d0e1f2` (create table + indexes; `down_revision=f6a7b8c9d0e1`). Strict
  `CompositeSamplePayload` (`extra="forbid"`, length/range-bounded) + `POST /api/v1/composite-sample`
  (signed via `verify_signature`) → persist + `_recompute_if_batch_exists` (idempotent dedupe on
  IntegrityError).
- Compliance (pure, `corroboration.py`): `derive_composite_sample_compliance(count, *, enforced=False)`
  → reason `missing_composite_sample`. **Inert by default** (deferred to the C10 unified gate, mirroring
  C1) so existing flows are unaffected. `assemble` gains `composite_sample_ok`. `recompute_batch_credit`
  counts photographed composite-sample rows and passes it through.

**Tests:** `test_composite_sample_flow.py` — deriver inert by default / enforced requires a photographed
sample; endpoint persists (round-trips kiln_qr) and stays non-gating; IntegrityError dedupe path.

**Gate:** Alembic `upgrade head → downgrade base → upgrade head` clean on an aiosqlite temp DB
(space-free path); codegen exit 0; backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 212 passed, 1 skipped** (+4 new C4
tests; the 1 failure is the pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**); `flutter analyze`
25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` **149 passed, 2 skipped**; `ruff`+`dart format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): site composite pile sub-sample evidence channel (Rainbow C4)`

---

## Phase C3 / C3b — Rainbow compliance: pyrolysis evidence + ignition energy  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** open-kiln — photos of **flame curtain / quenching / flame height** and **flame height
< 0.5 m**; closed-kiln — **ignition energy inputs**. Kiln-type-conditional (keyed off C0 `kiln_type`).
Additive; **no server migration** (fields live in the telemetry `payload_json`, which
`recompute_batch_credit` already reads).

**Changes**
- Client `PyrolysisTelemetry`: nullable `flameHeightM`, `ignitionEnergyType`, `ignitionEnergyAmount`.
  `schemaVersion` 18→19; additive `if (from<19)` migration; header v19. Writer params. `.g.dart` regenerated.
- Server `TelemetryPayload`: optional `flame_height_m` (`ge=0,le=5`), `ignition_energy_type`,
  `ignition_energy_amount` (persisted in payload_json).
- Compliance (pure, `corroboration.py`): `derive_pyrolysis_photo_compliance(kiln_type, smoke_evidence,
  flame_height_m)` → `(photos_ok, flame_height_ok)` (open-kiln requires the 3 tagged photographed stages
  + flame height < 0.5 m); `derive_ignition_compliance(kiln_type, ignition_energy_type)` (closed-kiln
  requires ignition energy). **Both inert unless `kiln_type` is explicitly `open`/`closed`** — so all
  existing flows (which don't set kiln_type) are unaffected. `assemble` gains `pyrolysis_photos_ok`,
  `flame_height_ok`, `ignition_ok` → reasons `missing_pyrolysis_photos` / `flame_height_out_of_range` /
  `missing_ignition_energy`. Wired into `recompute_batch_credit` from `tel_payload`.

**Tests:** `test_corroboration.py` — inert for non-open/closed; open-kiln needs all 3 photos + low flame;
closed-kiln needs ignition; reasons flip provisional.

**Gate:** codegen exit 0 (`flameHeightM` generated); backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 208 passed,
1 skipped** (the 1 pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**); `flutter analyze` 25 /
0 errors; `flutter test` **149 passed**; `ruff`+`dart format` applied. No server migration
(client migration v19 only; `migration_test.dart` covers v1→19).

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): kiln-conditional pyrolysis photo/flame-height + ignition compliance (Rainbow C3/C3b)`

---

## Phase C2 — Rainbow compliance: multi-sample moisture capture  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** handheld moisture meter, **≥1 reading per 100 kg of biomass, min 10 per run, each
photographed.** Previously only a single `moisture_percent`. This was the biggest data gap. Additive.

**Changes**
- Client `tables.dart`: new `MoistureReadings` table (one row per reading: `readingUuid`, `batchUuid`,
  `moisturePercent`, `sequence`, photo `sandboxPath`/`sha256Hash`; unique `{readingUuid}` and
  `{batchUuid, sequence}`). Registered in `@DriftDatabase`; `schemaVersion` 17→18; additive
  `createTable` migration; header v18. `.g.dart` regenerated.
- Client writer `insertMoistureReadingWithOutbox` (atomic domain-row + outbox, `targetTable
  'moisture_readings'`). The photo rides the **existing two-phase signed `/media` path** (payload carries
  `photo_path`/`sha256_hash`) — no new media plumbing. `kEndpointByTable` maps `moisture_readings` →
  `moisture`.
- Server: `MoistureReading` model (batch_uuid **indexed, not unique** — many per batch); `MoisturePayload`
  (strict) + `POST /api/v1/moisture` (signed) persisting by `reading_uuid`, then `_recompute_if_batch_exists`.
  Alembic migration `f6a7b8c9d0e1` (create table + indexes, reversible).
- Compliance: pure `corroboration.derive_moisture_compliance(photographed_count, biomass_input_kg)` —
  compliant iff `count >= max(10, ceil(biomass/100))`. `recompute_batch_credit` counts *photographed*
  moisture rows and passes `moisture_ok` to `assemble`, which adds `insufficient_moisture_samples` to
  `provisional_reasons` when short. The batch stays PROVISIONAL until the moisture rule is met (issuance
  gate reuse — no new mechanism).

**Tests:** `test_corroboration.py` unit (floor of 10; the ≥1/100 kg rule; reason flips provisional);
`test_moisture_flow.py` (9 readings → `insufficient_moisture_samples`; 10 → cleared). **Disclosed
migrations:** `test_lab_hcorg_channel.py` and `test_corroboration_flow.py` now post 10 moisture readings
so their exact-reason / not-provisional assertions still hold under the new rule.

**Gate:** codegen exit 0 (`MoistureReadings` generated); alembic single head `f6a7b8c9d0e1`, up/down/up
clean; backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 204 passed, 1 skipped** (the 1 pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`;
**0 new failures**); `flutter test` **149 passed**; `flutter analyze` **0 errors in the real app**;
`ruff`+`dart format` applied.

**Incidental (disclosed):** the untracked duplicate `New folder/` repo copy reappeared (session
interruption) and produced 129 analyzer errors purely within itself (no generated code). Deleted the
cruft, and added an `analyzer.exclude` for `New folder/**` / `uploaded/**` / `scratch/**` in
`analysis_options.yaml` so a stray duplicate can never pollute `flutter analyze` again. No real-app
error was involved.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): per-reading moisture capture + ≥1/100kg compliance rule (Rainbow C2)`

---

## Phase C1 — Rainbow compliance: biomass input amount + method  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Requirement:** "type and **amount** of biomass input (direct weighing or yield conversion ratio)."
Additive/non-breaking.

**Changes**
- Client `tables.dart` `BiomassSourcing`: nullable `biomassInputKg` + `biomassMeasurementMethod`.
  `schemaVersion` 16→17; additive `if (from<17)` migration; header v17. `.g.dart` regenerated.
- Client `insertBiomassSourcingWithOutbox`: optional params → companion + outbox payload.
- Server `BatchPayload`: optional `biomass_input_kg` (`ge=0,le=1e6`) + `biomass_measurement_method:
  Literal["direct_weigh","yield_conversion"]`. `Batch` model gains both nullable columns; `create_batch`
  persists them. Alembic migration `e5f6a7b8c9d0` (additive, reversible).
- Compliance reason (`missing_biomass_input` / `missing_conversion_factor`) is wired in the C10 capstone;
  C1 is data capture + persistence only.

**Tests:** `test_biomass_input.py` — persists on `Batch`; invalid method enum → 422; omission still 201.

**Gate:** codegen exit 0 (`biomassInputKg` generated); alembic single head `e5f6a7b8c9d0`, up/down/up clean;
backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 199 passed, 1 skipped** (the 1 pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`;
**0 new failures**); `flutter analyze` 25 / 0 errors; `flutter test` **149 passed**;
`ruff`+`dart format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): capture biomass input amount + measurement method (Rainbow C1)`

---

## Phase C0 — Rainbow compliance: kiln type/id foundation  `[COMPLIANCE]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** first Rainbow BiCRS methodology-compliance phase (spec:
`terracipher_reports/RAINBOW_COMPLIANCE_PROMPT.md`). Additive/non-breaking: the open-vs-closed kiln
dimension that later phases branch on.

**Changes**
- Client `tables.dart`: `PyrolysisTelemetry` gains nullable `kilnType` (`'open'|'closed'`) + `kilnId`.
  `schemaVersion` 15→16; `onUpgrade` `if (from<16)` adds both columns (additive); header history updated.
  Drift `.g.dart` regenerated via `build_runner` (verified working in-env).
- Client `pyrolysis_writer.dart`: optional `kilnType`/`kilnId` params → companion + outbox payload.
- Server `TelemetryPayload`: optional `kiln_type: Literal["open","closed"]` + `kiln_id` (bounded);
  persisted in `payload_json` (side table is schemaless-blob, no server migration needed).

**Tests:** `test_endpoint_schemas.py::test_kiln_type_persists_and_is_validated` — valid `open` persists
+ round-trips; invalid `banana` → 422. `migration_test.dart` covers v1→16.

**Gate**
- Codegen `build_runner` exit 0; `kilnType` present in generated code. `python -c import server` clean.
- Backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 196 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`;
  **0 new failures**. `flutter analyze` → **25 / 0 errors** (down from 34: `build_runner
  --delete-conflicting-outputs` cleaned untracked junk at repo root — `scratch/`, `test_pragma.dart`,
  `test_quote.dart` — none version-controlled, no committed-tree impact); `flutter test` **149 passed**.
- **Incidental (disclosed):** two hygiene tests (`test_p0_17_no_hardcoded_db_default`,
  `test_p1_20_uploads_in_gitignore`) asserted against an untracked duplicate repo copy under
  `uploaded/New folder/` (same cruft class as the deleted top-level `New folder/`). `build_runner`
  cleaned that cruft, so the tests were **retargeted to the real `backend/db.py` and repo-root
  `.gitignore`** — which genuinely satisfy the assertions. No tracked file was deleted.
- `ruff` + `dart format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `feat(dmrv): kiln type/id foundation for Rainbow compliance (C0)`

## Phase 16 — Field reliability & data-loss cluster (post-audit P1)  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** the non-attacker-driven data-integrity/data-loss findings from the full re-audit. Spec:
`terracipher_reports/PHASE_15_17_AUTHENTICITY_FIXES.md` (Phase 16). Mostly `lib/`; 16D also touches `server.py`.

- **16A — atomic outbox row-lease.** The WorkManager background isolate and the foreground loop each had
  their own `SyncQueueManager`/`_isSyncing`, so both could grab the same PENDING row (double POST / double
  media upload / delete-under-the-other-worker). `_triggerSync` now (1) reclaims stale `PROCESSING` leases
  (>120 s) back to PENDING, (2) atomically claims each row `PENDING→PROCESSING` via `customUpdate`
  (`WHERE status='PENDING'`) and skips if 0 rows were claimed, (3) releases `PROCESSING→PENDING` on transient
  failure. Success→SYNCED, permanent→FAILED_PERMANENTLY unchanged.
- **16B — stamp before delete.** `_uploadMedia` now stamps `media_synced_at` **before** `file.delete()`;
  a crash between delete and commit no longer reports server-accepted evidence as a permanent failure.
- **16C — 401/403 are retryable.** Both JSON and media classifiers treat 401/403 (enrollment/clock/
  signature races) as transient (retry w/ backoff) instead of `FAILED_PERMANENTLY`; 422/other-4xx stay
  permanent. Prevents silent field data-loss for a device that syncs before registration propagates.
- **16D — `closeBatch` propagates.** It now enqueues a signed `system_metadata` outbox row atomically with
  the `CLOSED_PENDING_UPLOAD` update, and the server `/metadata` endpoint **upserts** on `batch_uuid`
  conflict (was a silent no-op) so the close actually reaches the server.
- **16E — `secureWipe` hardening.** Deletes key material **first**, guards a process-level
  `_dbWipeInProgress` latch that makes `_openConnection` refuse to re-open mid-wipe (no "ghost DB"),
  `PRAGMA secure_delete=ON` at **open** time (whole-life page zeroing, not just at wipe), and
  `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before close so no plaintext WAL frames survive.
- **16F — migration data-loss.** v11 timestamp normalizer no longer `STRFTIME`s offset timestamps to NULL
  (leaves valid `+HH:MM` instants untouched); v15 pre-cleans any non-JSON legacy content in the three
  telemetry JSON columns before the `json_valid` `TableMigration`, so one malformed row can't abort the
  upgrade and brick the DB.

**Tests:** `test_metadata_upsert.py` (new, 16D server); existing `test/data/local/migration_test.dart`
(guards the customStatement path) green; full client suite exercises the sync loop. No existing test broke.

**Gate**
- Backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 195 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`;
  **0 new failures**. `flutter analyze` → **34 / 0 errors** (baseline). `flutter test` → **149 passed, 2 skipped**.
  Migration test green. `ruff` + `dart format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(client): outbox row-lease, crash-safe media stamp, retryable 403, wipe hardening, migration data-loss (Phase 16)`

---

## Phase 15 — Authenticity (post-audit P0)  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** the "mint-money" holes from the full brutal re-audit. Spec:
`terracipher_reports/PHASE_15_17_AUTHENTICITY_FIXES.md`. Cross-stack (backend + `lib/`).

**15A — Sign the media evidence channel (CRITICAL).** `/api/v1/media` was the only state-changing
endpoint with no Ed25519 auth — the evidence photos were anonymous. Added `verify_media_signature`
(server) over a FROZEN media canonical `POST\n/api/v1/media\n{idem}\n{declared_sha256_lower}\n{batch_uuid}\n{device_id}`
(signs the DECLARED hash, not the non-reproducible multipart body; the endpoint still enforces
calculated==declared). `upload_media` now `Depends(verify_media_signature)`, parses `X-Batch-UUID` safely
(**400** not 500 on malformed), and binds ownership (**403 not_your_batch** if `batch.device_id != device`).
Client `_uploadMedia` now signs via new `CryptoSigner.signMediaUpload`; canonical frozen in a comment on
both sides. New `test_media_auth.py` (unsigned→401, wrong-hash-sig→403, malformed-uuid→400, non-owner→403,
happy path→200+anchors).

**15B — Bind the issuance signature to the batch (CRITICAL).** `sign_lca_audit` HMAC'd only the physical
inputs, so identical inputs → identical signature across batches. Now `sign_lca_audit(..., *, batch_uuid)`
includes `batch_uuid` in the signed payload. New test: same inputs + different batch → different signature.

**15C — Bound the self-asserted credit inputs (HIGH).** `YieldPayload.wet_yield_weight_kg` →
`Field(gt=0, le=100_000)` (+ dry-yield bound); `TelemetryPayload.temperature_readings` gets a per-value
`[-50,1500]` validator (a constant `200.0` array can no longer inflate the CH₄ gate with absurd values).
Kiln-capacity cross-check documented as a follow-up (needs a domain-defined ratio — not invented).

**15D — Enforce `lab_h_corg` at the DB (P0-).** Added a `CHECK (lab_h_corg IS NULL OR 0.1..1.5)` on
`batches` (model `__table_args__` + reversible migration `d4e5f6a7b8c9`) so the range holds even if a
future write path bypasses the API model. H:Corg 0.4 tier cliff **flagged to methodology owner** (not
silently changed) and pinned by a test.

**Affected tests migrated (disclosed — media now requires a signature):** `test_gps_corroboration.py`,
`test_media_anchoring.py`, `test_media_path_leak.py`, `test_api.py` (media), `test_p0_25_anchor.py`,
`test_hardening.py` (4 media cases), `test_p0_24_upload_limit.py` — all now sign via the new
`crypto_utils.sign_media` helper with an enrolled, batch-owning device. No assertion weakened (the
invalid-device / missing-device cases assert rejection across {400,401,403}).

**Gate**
- `grep "Depends(verify_media_signature)"` present; `grep "batch_uuid" lca_engine.py` in signed payload.
- New: `test_media_auth.py` (6), `test_lab_hcorg_db_constraint.py` (3), signature-uniqueness + yield/temp
  bound cases — all green.
- Full backend `pytest` → **1 failed, 194 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is the documented pre-existing
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**. `flutter analyze` 34 / 0 errors; `flutter test`
  149 passed / 2 skipped (client `_uploadMedia` + `signMediaUpload` changes). Migration up/down/up clean,
  single head `d4e5f6a7b8c9`. `ruff` + `dart format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(dmrv): authenticate media channel + bind issuance signature + bound credit inputs (Phase 15)`

---

## Phase 11-R — Bound string fields and total request body size  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** `backend/server.py` (the four Phase-11 models + a body-size middleware),
`backend/tests/test_endpoint_schemas.py`. Spec: `terracipher_reports/HARDENING_8R_9R_11R_FIXES.md`
(Phase 11-R). Backend-only.

**What was wrong (brutal re-audit of Phase 11):** Phase 11 bounded list length but not string length or
total body size — free-text fields (`artisan_id`, methodologies, paths, timestamps) had no `max_length`
and Starlette has no default request-body cap, so a single huge string / many-huge-dicts payload was
accepted (DoS surface).

**Changes (`server.py`):**
- Added `max_length` to every free-text `str` field across `TelemetryPayload` / `YieldPayload` /
  `MetadataPayload` / `ApplicationPayload` (identifiers/methodologies 128, paths 512, timestamps 64,
  hex hashes/uuids 64). `feedstock_species` is already enum-bounded via `CORG_TABLE`.
- Added an `@app.middleware("http")` `_limit_body_size` that rejects oversized bodies by
  `Content-Length` **before** parsing: JSON endpoints capped at `_MAX_JSON_BODY_BYTES = 2 MB` (a max
  100k-float telemetry log is well under that); `/api/v1/media` gets `_MAX_MEDIA_BODY_BYTES = 12 MB`
  headroom so its multipart 10 MB upload path is unaffected (its handler still enforces the real 10 MB
  cap while streaming). Requires `from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse`.

**Tests (`test_endpoint_schemas.py`, extended):** over-long `artisan_id` (10 000 chars) → **422**;
a well-shaped telemetry body >2 MB → **413** (checked before parse). Media-path tests
(`test_gps_corroboration.py`, `test_media_anchoring.py`) re-run green — the middleware does not break
uploads.

**Gate**
- `grep -c "payload: dict" server.py` → **0** (unchanged from Phase 11).
- `pytest -q tests/test_endpoint_schemas.py tests/test_gps_corroboration.py tests/remediation/test_media_anchoring.py` → **18 passed**.
- `pytest` (full) → **1 failed, 183 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is the documented pre-existing
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**. `ruff format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): bound string fields and total request body size`

---

## Phase 9-R — Platform attestation: stop pretending it's a control  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** `backend/server.py` (`recompute_batch_credit`), `backend/corroboration.py` (`assemble`),
`backend/tests/test_corroboration.py`, `FINDINGS_BACKLOG.md`. Spec:
`terracipher_reports/HARDENING_8R_9R_11R_FIXES.md` (Phase 9-R). **Option B chosen** (see below).

**What was wrong (brutal re-audit of Phase 9):** `recompute_batch_credit` rejected only when
`hw_attestation` was a **dict** with `status=="INVALID"`, but the real client sends a **list** of base64
blobs — so the gate **could never fire**. There is no real Play Integrity / DeviceCheck verification; a
rooted device's forged blob passes. It was cosmetic security.

**Decision (Option B, non-blocking + honest):** Option A (unverified attestation → permanently
PROVISIONAL) would halt **all** final issuance until a real verifier exists — a business decision not to
make unilaterally. Instead: remove the dead check, log a loud `SECURITY TODO` warning when an
unverified blob is present, and gate real enforcement behind a single flag so flipping to Option A later
is one line.

**Changes**
- `corroboration.assemble` gains `attestation_ok: bool = True`; when False it appends an ordered
  `attestation_unverified` reason (pure, unit-tested). Default True keeps it inert.
- `server.py`: added `_ATTESTATION_ENFORCED = False` policy flag (documented). `recompute_batch_credit`
  replaces the dead `isinstance(dict)` block with: `attestation_verified = False  # TODO(security)`, a
  `log.warning(...)` when a blob is present-but-unverified, and `attestation_ok = True if not
  _ATTESTATION_ENFORCED else attestation_verified` passed into `assemble`. No 403, no provisional change
  while the flag is False.
- `FINDINGS_BACKLOG.md`: new **CRITICAL · OPEN** item — real attestation verification is unbuilt;
  documents the flip to Option A once a verifier + Google/Apple credentials exist.

**Gate**
- `grep -c "isinstance(attestation, dict)" server.py` → **0** (dead check gone).
- `pytest -q tests/test_corroboration.py tests/test_corroboration_flow.py` → **17 passed** (incl. new
  `attestation_ok` inert-default and enforced-flips-provisional cases).
- `pytest` (full) → **1 failed, 181 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is the documented pre-existing
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**. `ruff format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): remove dead attestation check; warn + gate enforcement behind a flag`

---

## Phase 8-R — Permanence (H:Corg) authenticated + bounded, never client-asserted  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** `backend/server.py`, `backend/tests/test_lab_hcorg_channel.py` (new), migrate
`tests/remediation/test_lab_hcorg_ingestion.py` + `tests/test_lca_provisional.py`. Spec:
`terracipher_reports/HARDENING_8R_9R_11R_FIXES.md` (Phase 8-R). Backend-only (client never sent it).

**What was wrong (brutal re-audit of Phase 8):** `lab_h_corg` — the permanence determinant for issuance
— was accepted on `BatchPayload` **unauthenticated and unbounded from the device**, and any value
`< 0.4` (incl. `0.01`/negative) took `step3_cremain`'s max-permanence branch. A device could POST
`lab_h_corg: 0.05` → **non-provisional, maximally-inflated credit**. Same class of bug 7-R fixed for the
other inputs; it survived in the permanence path.

**Changes (`server.py`):**
- Removed `lab_h_corg` from `BatchPayload` and from the `create_batch` construction/recompute path.
  `extra="forbid"` now 422s any client that self-asserts it.
- New `LabHCorgRequest` (`extra="forbid"`, `lab_h_corg: float = Field(..., ge=0.1, le=1.5)`) +
  **`POST /api/v1/admin/lab-hcorg`** — admin-authenticated via `hmac.compare_digest(x_admin_secret,
  _ADMIN_SECRET)` (mirrors `mint_enrollment_token`), 404 on unknown batch — which sets the ratio and
  re-runs `recompute_batch_credit`. Column `Batch.lab_h_corg` already existed (7-R); no migration.
- **Folded in:** `recompute_batch_credit` now signs the LCA audit **only when the batch is not
  provisional** (`lca_signature = None if batch.provisional else sign_lca_audit(...)`) — a provisional
  audit must never look issuable downstream.

**Tests**
- `test_lab_hcorg_channel.py` (new, 8 incl. params): `lab_h_corg` on `/batches` → 422; endpoint needs
  admin secret (401); out-of-range `0.01`/`-0.2`/`9.0` → 422; unknown batch → 404; corroborated batch +
  in-range ratio → 200 + `provisional False` + non-null `lca_signature`; provisional batch →
  `lca_signature is None`.
- Migrated (disclosed): `test_lab_hcorg_ingestion.py` and `test_lca_provisional.py::test_batch_with_
  lab_hcorg_is_not_provisional` now corroborate the batch then set the ratio via the admin channel; the
  credit-ordering / not-provisional intents are preserved.

**Gate**
- `grep -n "lab_h_corg" server.py` → only in `LabHCorgRequest`/the admin endpoint/`recompute` param +
  `batch.lab_h_corg` fallback; **not** in `BatchPayload` or the `create_batch` payload path.
- `pytest -q` the lab/provisional/flow set → **17 passed**.
- `pytest` (full) → **1 failed, 179 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is the documented pre-existing
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**. (One affected test disclosed:
  `tests/remediation/test_lca_defensibility.py` asserted `lca_signature is not None` on an
  uncorroborated batch — updated to assert the batch is provisional and therefore unsigned, while
  still asserting the audit trail/methodology are present.) `ruff format` applied.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): accept lab H:Corg only via authenticated, range-checked channel; don't sign provisional audits`

---

## Phase 12 — Gate raw telemetry query behind `@visibleForTesting`  `[REFACTOR]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `lib/data/local/app_database.dart`, test callers in `test/`.

**What was wrong:** `AppDatabase.getBatchTelemetryUnsafe()` — a public method with "Unsafe" in its name
and a "Test-only" comment — lived on the production database class, callable from anywhere.

**Changes:** renamed `getBatchTelemetryUnsafe` → **`getBatchTelemetryRaw`** and annotated it
`@visibleForTesting` (`flutter/foundation.dart`, already imported) so a production `lib/` call now trips
the analyzer. The query already uses a bound `Variable` (no interpolation) — injection-safe — clarified
in the docstring. Updated the sole caller `test/app_database_telemetry_query_test.dart`.

**Gate**
- `grep -rc "getBatchTelemetryUnsafe" lib test` → **0**; new name present in `lib` (definition) + `test`.
- `flutter analyze` → **33 issues** — identical to baseline, no new (no `lib/` caller, so no
  `invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member`).
- `flutter test test/app_database_telemetry_query_test.dart` → **1 passed**.
- `flutter test` (full) → 0 new failures.
- `dart format` applied to both touched files.

**Intended commit:** `refactor(client): gate raw telemetry query behind @visibleForTesting`

---

## Phase 11 — Strict schemas + size bounds on the `dict` endpoints  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook + finding #8):** `backend/server.py` (`/telemetry`, `/yield`, `/metadata`,
`/application`), `backend/tests/test_endpoint_schemas.py` (new), migrate `test_stub_persistence.py`.
Spec: `terracipher_reports/NEXT_FIXES_PROMPT.md` (Phase 11).

**What was wrong:** the four side-endpoints accepted a raw `payload: dict` — no schema, no size limit —
while `/batches` was strictly validated. Unknown keys and unbounded arrays were accepted. The auth
dependency param was mistyped `is_verified: bool` (it returns a device-id **str**).

**Changes (`server.py`):**
- Added four `extra="forbid"` Pydantic models — `TelemetryPayload`, `YieldPayload`, `MetadataPayload`,
  `ApplicationPayload` — with identity fields required, the rest optional (accepts the real client and
  minimal evidence payloads), and **bounded lists** (`temperature_readings max_length=100_000`,
  `smoke_evidence`/`hw_attestation max_length=1_000`; application lat/lon/transport range-checked).
- Replaced `payload: dict` with the typed models on all four endpoints; `is_verified: bool` →
  `device_id: str = Depends(verify_signature)`. Persist `json.dumps(payload.model_dump(mode="json"))`.
- **Canonical keys preserved** (`temperature_readings`, `wet_yield_weight_kg`, `latitude`/`longitude`)
  so Phase-7-R corroboration still reads them; the `_recompute_if_batch_exists` calls are kept.

**Tests**
- `test_endpoint_schemas.py` (new, 9): per endpoint — valid minimal payload → 201; unknown field → 422;
  oversized `temperature_readings` (100_001) → 422.
- `test_stub_persistence.py` (migrated — disclosed): its foreign keys (`some_data`/`yield_kg`/`field_id`)
  would now 422; switched to canonical fields, and the telemetry full-dict-equality assertion → a
  canonical-field round-trip check (the strict model normalizes optionals to null).

**Gate**
- `grep -c "payload: dict" server.py` → **0**; `grep -c "is_verified: bool"` → **0**; all 5 signed
  endpoints use `device_id: str = Depends(verify_signature)`.
- `pytest -q tests/test_endpoint_schemas.py` + migrated stub + `test_corroboration_flow.py` → **14 passed**.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **1 failed, 171 passed, 1 skipped** — the 1 is the documented pre-existing
  `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`; **0 new failures**.
- `ruff format` applied to `server.py` + touched tests.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): strict schemas + size bounds on telemetry/yield/metadata/application`

## Phase R2 — Kill the `dev-token` enrollment backdoor  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope:** `backend/db.py` (`init_db`), delete `backend/check_db.py`, `backend/tests/test_no_dev_token_seed.py` (new).
Spec: `terracipher_reports/NEXT_FIXES_PROMPT.md` (Phase R2).

**What was wrong:** `init_db()` — run on every boot via `server.py` `lifespan` — unconditionally seeded
an `EnrollmentToken("dev-token")` and **reset its `used_at = None` on every boot**, so a permanent,
always-fresh enrollment token existed in production. Phase 3 had removed `register_device`'s special
case, but the backdoor survived in this seed block (logged in FINDINGS_BACKLOG since Phase 3).

**Changes**
- `db.py` `init_db()`: removed the entire dev-token seed block (and its local `EnrollmentToken`/`select`
  imports). `init_db()` is now purely the Alembic-upgrade runner; no data seeding. Not gated behind a
  flag — a misconfigured flag would still be a backdoor; local dev mints a token via
  `/api/v1/admin/mint-token`.
- Deleted `backend/check_db.py`: a manual script that *reset* the dev-token `used_at` (re-opening the
  backdoor) **and** read `DeviceKey.hmac_key` — a column removed in Phase 5, so the script was already
  broken/dead.

**Test (`tests/test_no_dev_token_seed.py`, new, 3):** source-guard (the token string no longer appears
in `db.py`); a fresh DB contains no such `EnrollmentToken`; `/api/v1/register` with the dev token →
**401 `invalid_enrollment_token`**.

**Gate**
- `grep -rl "dev-token" backend --include=*.py` (excluding tests) → **none**; `check_db.py` absent.
- `pytest -q tests/test_no_dev_token_seed.py` → **3 passed**.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **1 failed, 162 passed, 1 skipped** — **0 new failures**, and one *fewer*
  pre-existing failure: `test_migrations_gated` now PASSES because it failed precisely on
  `init_db()` querying `enrollment_tokens` before the table existed (the removed seed block). The
  lone remaining failure is the documented Phase-0 pre-existing `test_p0_21_hmac_secret`
  (import-isolation issue, not a product defect).
- `ruff format` applied to `db.py` + the new test.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): remove dev-token enrollment seed/backdoor from init_db`

## Phase 7-R — Contract reconciliation: corroborate credit inputs server-side  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Spec:** `terracipher_reports/CONTRACT_RECONCILIATION_PROMPT.md`. Executed after discovering (via the
`test_client_contract.py` xfail probes) that the backend had been hardened against a payload contract
the real Flutter client does not produce, and that the suite globally mocked the DB for the most
important anti-fraud query. Backend-only; **no `lib/` changes** (the client is the contract source of truth).

**What was wrong (three verified divergences):**
- **A** — Phase 7 made `wet_yield_kg` / `min_recorded_temp_c` / `transport_distance_km` **required** on
  `BatchPayload`, but the client never sends them and they don't exist at batch-creation time (the
  batch is written at harvest; yield/telemetry/application evidence arrive later). Every real `/batches`
  sync 422'd.
- **B** — client sends `temperature_readings` / `hw_attestation` (snake); server read
  `temperatureReadingsJson` / `hwAttestationJson` (camel) → burn-temp gate never saw real readings.
- **Test integrity** — `conftest.py` autouse-monkeypatched `AsyncSession.execute` suite-wide to fake
  `{"temperatureReadingsJson": [650]*60}`, so much of the suite verified the mock, not the code.

**Design:** credit inputs are **corroborated server-side from the evidence streams, never trusted from
the batch payload**; a batch stays **PROVISIONAL** (never issued) until each is corroborated —
generalizing Phase 8's flag to every corroboration gap.

**Changes**
- `backend/corroboration.py` (new): pure, DB-free, unit-tested derivers `derive_min_temp` (canonical
  `temperature_readings`, ≥60 samples), `derive_wet_yield` (`wet_yield_weight_kg`), `derive_transport_km`
  (Haversine, injected), and `assemble` (provisional + ordered reasons).
- `server.py`: `BatchPayload` three LCA fields → `Optional` (default `None`); removed the obsolete
  `_validate_burn_compliance` payload-temp validator and the now-unused `model_validator` import. New
  thin `recompute_batch_credit(session, batch, *, lab_h_corg)` loads telemetry/yield/application, runs
  the pure derivers + `calculate_carbon_credit`, writes `wet_yield_kg/min_recorded_temp_c/
  transport_distance_km/net_credit/provisional/provisional_reasons/lca_*`, and fails closed on an
  explicitly-INVALID `hw_attestation`. `create_batch` is now a thin orchestrator (idempotency →
  teleport check → build row from client fields → `recompute_batch_credit` → persist → anchor). New
  `_recompute_if_batch_exists` helper called from `create_telemetry`/`create_yield`/`create_application`
  so credit converges as evidence lands (replaced the bespoke transport recompute in `create_application`).
- `models.py` + migration `c3d4e5f6a7b8`: `Batch.lab_h_corg` (Float, nullable — persists a lab value so a
  later-stream recompute can't lose it) and `Batch.provisional_reasons` (Text, nullable — audit trail).
  `wet_yield_kg` DB default `100.0` → `0.0` (no fabricating default). Reversible (up/down/up verified).

**Tests**
- `test_corroboration.py` (new, 14): unit-pin every derivation rule incl. the camelCase key being ignored.
- `test_corroboration_flow.py` (new, 1): batch lands provisional with 0 inputs → telemetry → yield →
  application, asserting each input corroborates and the batch is provisional only for `assumed_h_corg`.
- `test_client_contract.py`: both probes now **pass with the `xfail` markers removed** (strict-xfail
  forced their deletion); CONTRACT-B check retargeted to `corroboration.py`.

**Affected tests migrated (disclosed — direct consequence; no assertion weakened, intent preserved):**
- `test_required_credit_inputs.py` (Phase 7's premise, reversed) — rewritten: omitting inputs is now
  **accepted + PROVISIONAL** with the right reason, never a fabricated credit.
- `test_hmac_verification.py::test_hmac_verification_success` — valid sig now → 201 provisional (was 400).
- `test_hardening.py::test_p0_16_single_high_temp_rejected` — client-asserted temp is ignored → 201
  provisional (a client can't assert its way to a credit).
- `test_api.py::test_valid_payload_returns_201` — asserts `provisional is True` (was `net_credit>0`).
- `test_lca_provisional.py::test_batch_with_lab_hcorg_is_not_provisional` — now posts full evidence +
  lab H:Corg for `provisional False` (not-provisional requires both).
- `test_lab_hcorg_ingestion.py` + `test_temperature_log_verification.py` — camel→snake telemetry key +
  post `/yield` so credit is corroborated; `test_single_sample_temp_rejected` now asserts 201 provisional.
- `conftest.py` — removed the global `AsyncSession.execute` mock (kept device seeding).

**Gate**
- `grep -c "temperatureReadingsJson\|hwAttestationJson"` in `server.py`+`corroboration.py` → **0**.
- `grep "wet_yield_kg: float = Field(\.\.\."` server.py → **none** (no longer required).
- No global `AsyncSession.execute` mock in `conftest.py`.
- `test_client_contract.py` → **2 passed, xfail markers removed**; `test_corroboration*.py` → **15 passed**.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **2 failed, 158 passed, 1 skipped** — the 2 are the documented Phase-0
  pre-existing failures; **0 new failures**.
- Migration `alembic upgrade/downgrade/upgrade` on isolated aiosqlite → clean; single linear head.
- `ruff format` applied (4 files reformatted; suite re-confirmed green after).

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): corroborate credit inputs server-side; batch PROVISIONAL until evidence lands`

## Phase 8 — LCA: measured permanence or PROVISIONAL  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/lca_engine.py`, `backend/server.py` (`create_batch`),
`backend/models.py` (+ migration), `backend/tests/test_lca_provisional.py` (new).

**What was wrong:** `step3_cremain`/`calculate_carbon_credit` defaulted `h_corg_ratio` to `0.35`
and `lab_h_corg` is usually absent, so the permanence factor — the scientific basis for issuance —
was a silent assumption on the common path. `gross_c_sink_t_co2e` was computed, stored, and never
used in the net credit.

**Changes**
- `lca_engine.py`:
  - `step3_cremain(dry_mass_t, corg_pct, *, h_corg_ratio, t=100)` — `h_corg_ratio` is now a
    **required keyword-only** arg; explicit `None` raises `ValueError`. No silent 0.35 default.
  - `calculate_carbon_credit(..., h_corg_ratio: float | None = None)` — `provisional = h_corg_ratio is None`;
    falls back to the conservative `0.35` only to produce a number, and records `audit.provisional`.
  - `LCAAudit` gains `provisional: bool = True`; `gross_c_sink_t_co2e` re-labelled "informational only —
    NOT used in issuance".
- `models.py`: `Batch.provisional: bool` column (default `True`).
- `server.py`: `create_batch` sets `provisional=lca.provisional` on the row; `BatchResponse.provisional`
  added and populated in all three return paths (new / duplicate / race).
- migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6_batches_add_provisional.py`: `batch_alter_table` add `provisional BOOLEAN
  NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE` (existing rows backfill TRUE), with a `drop_column` downgrade.

**Design deviation from the runbook (disclosed):** the runbook's Phase-8 sketch says
"set `status='PROVISIONAL'`". I instead added a **dedicated `provisional` column + `BatchResponse.provisional`**
and left `status` alone. Rationale: `status` encodes **photo-evidence anchoring** (RECEIVED ↔ UNVERIFIED,
flipped by the media endpoint and asserted by `test_p0_25_anchor`/`test_late_photo`/`test_batch_without_photo`,
none of which send `lab_h_corg`). Overloading `status` with PROVISIONAL would conflate two orthogonal
concerns and break those tests. The runbook explicitly permits this ("Migration: add `provisional` handling
if a column is needed"). The Phase-8 test asserts the **flag/response**, not a `status` string. **No existing
test or fixture needed changing** (full suite ran with 0 new failures).

**Test (`backend/tests/test_lca_provisional.py`, new, 7 cases):** `step3_cremain` omitted ratio → `TypeError`,
explicit `None` → `ValueError`; no `lab_h_corg` → `provisional True`; with `lab_h_corg` → `provisional False`;
provisional fallback yields the **same number** as explicit `0.35`; audit determinism (sorted-JSON equality +
identical `sign_lca_audit`); API: batch without `lab_h_corg` → response `provisional: true`, with it → `false`.

**Gate**
- `pytest -q tests/test_lca_provisional.py` → **7 passed**; `tests/test_lca_engine.py` + lab-H:Corg + LCA
  defensibility → all green (29 passed together).
- `pytest -q` (full) → **2 failed, 138 passed, 1 skipped** — the 2 are the documented Phase-0 pre-existing
  failures; **0 new failures** (138 = 131 + 7 new Phase-8 tests).
- Migration cycle (bonus, isolated SQLite): `upgrade head` adds `provisional`; `downgrade -1` removes it;
  `upgrade head` re-adds — clean.
- `ruff format` applied to `lca_engine.py`, `models.py`, `server.py`, the migration, and the new test.

**Intended commit:** `fix(lca): require measured H:Corg or mark batch PROVISIONAL; never issue on assumptions`

---

## Phase 9 — Server-side GPS corroboration (drop client mock header) + media integrity  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `backend/server.py` (`upload_media`, `create_batch`), `backend/models.py` (+ migration),
`backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/tests/test_gps_corroboration.py` (new). **Plus a folded-in media-integrity
fix (disclosed below).**

**What was wrong:** `upload_media` rejected uploads on the client-supplied `X-Mock-Location: true` header —
an honor-system control the fraudster simply sets to `false`. Additionally (my earlier finding) the endpoint
flipped a batch `UNVERIFIED → RECEIVED` for *any* uploaded file, never checking it against the batch's declared
photo hash.

**Changes**
- `server.py`:
  - Removed the `X-Mock-Location` 403 check. `mock_location_enabled` remains a stored review signal; the
    teleport check is retained.
  - `import piexif`; helpers `_exif_to_decimal`, `_parse_exif_gps`, `_gps_mismatch_km`, `_evaluate_anchor`.
  - `upload_media` parses the photo's EXIF GPS into `MediaFile.exif_lat/exif_lon`.
  - **Anchoring is now integrity-checked** via `_evaluate_anchor` (used by both `upload_media` for the
    batch-first case and `create_batch` for the media-first case): a photo upgrades a batch to `RECEIVED`
    **only** if its SHA-256 matches the batch's declared `sha256_hash`; if the photo's EXIF GPS disagrees
    with the batch's claimed coordinates by **>1 km** the batch is set to `QUARANTINE_GPS_MISMATCH`. A batch
    asserting a photo now starts `UNVERIFIED` and is upgraded only on a matching, corroborated photo.
- `models.py`: `MediaFile.exif_lat`, `MediaFile.exif_lon` (nullable Float).
- migration `b2c3d4e5f6a7_media_add_exif_gps.py`: add the two columns (nullable), reversible.
- `requirements.txt`: `piexif==1.1.3` (installed this phase).

**Folded-in beyond the runbook (disclosed):** the SHA-match anchoring requirement is *my finding*, not in the
runbook (the runbook's Phase 9 edits `upload_media` but never adds it). It is server-only and closes the
"anchor any file to flip a batch verified" half of the unauthenticated-media critical. **The other half —
requiring an Ed25519 signature on `/api/v1/media` — is deliberately NOT done here:** it is cross-stack (the
client `sync_queue_manager._uploadMedia` must sign the upload) and changes the frozen canonical string, which
needs a dedicated phase + a design decision. Flagged as the recommended next security phase.

**Affected tests (disclosed):**
- `test_hardening.py::test_p1_18_*` — was `..._rejected` asserting `X-Mock-Location:true` → 403; renamed to
  `..._has_no_effect` asserting 200 (Phase 9 dropped it as a control).
- `test_media_anchoring.py::test_media_anchors_by_explicit_batch_uuid` — declared `sha256_hash="a"*64` but
  uploaded a photo with a different hash and expected `RECEIVED`. That encoded the old "any file verifies"
  behavior; updated so the batch declares the uploaded photo's real hash (now legitimately `RECEIVED`).
  (`test_p0_25_anchor` / `test_late_photo` / `test_batch_without_photo` already used matching hashes and pass
  unchanged.)

**Test (`backend/tests/test_gps_corroboration.py`, new, 3 cases):** crafts JPEGs with real EXIF GPS
(Pillow + piexif) — matching photo/claim GPS → `RECEIVED`; Delhi photo vs London claim (>1 km) →
`QUARANTINE_GPS_MISMATCH`; `X-Mock-Location: true` on `/media` has no effect (200).

**Gate**
- `grep -c "x-mock-location" backend/server.py` → 0.
- `pytest -q tests/test_gps_corroboration.py` + the affected anchoring/mock tests → 14 passed.
- `pytest -q` (full) → **2 failed, 141 passed, 1 skipped** — the 2 are the Phase-0 pre-existing failures;
  **0 new failures** (141 = 138 + 3 new Phase-9 tests).
- Migration cycle (isolated SQLite): `upgrade/downgrade/upgrade` adds/removes/re-adds `exif_lat`/`exif_lon` cleanly.
- `ruff format` applied to `server.py`, `models.py`, the migration, and the new test.

**Residual (logged):** full Ed25519 **authentication** of `/api/v1/media` (the other half of the critical) is
deferred to a dedicated cross-stack phase. CORS `allow_headers` still lists the dead `X-Hmac-Signature`
(Phase 13 hygiene).

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): drop client mock-GPS header; corroborate GPS via photo EXIF; bind photo hash to batch`

---

## Phase 10 — Background sync awaits real completion  `[FIX]`  ✅ DONE

**Scope (runbook):** `lib/services/sync_queue_manager.dart`, `test/background_sync_test.dart` (extend).

**What was wrong:** `callbackDispatcher` fired `kickSync()` **un-awaited**, slept a fixed
`Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 10))`, then returned `true` unconditionally — so WorkManager's
success/retry signal was meaningless (sync completion was a coin flip) and the `ProviderContainer`
was never disposed (leak). The self-admitting comments said as much.

**Changes (`sync_queue_manager.dart`):**
- `void kickSync() => _triggerSync();` → **`Future<void> kickSync() => _triggerSync();`** (the
  function already delegated to a `Future<void>`; only the return type was being thrown away).
- `callbackDispatcher`: now `await container.read(syncQueueManagerProvider).kickSync()` inside a
  `try` → `return true`; `catch` → log + `return false`; **`finally` → `container.dispose()`**.
  Removed the 10-second sleep entirely. (`_triggerSync` swallows its own loop exceptions in a
  `try/finally`, so awaiting it yields true completion without hanging.)

**Test (`test/background_sync_test.dart`, extended):** added a case asserting `kickSync()` returns
`isA<Future<void>>()` and that awaiting it completes within 5s (locks in the void→Future change and
guards against the sleep regressing). The existing 3 cases call `kickSync()` and still pass unchanged.
The `callbackDispatcher`/WorkManager path itself can't be exercised under `flutter test` (no
WorkManager host), so the Future-return assertion is the durable behavioral lock.

**Gate**
- `grep -c "Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 10))" lib/services/sync_queue_manager.dart` → **0**.
- `grep -n "Future<void> kickSync"` → present (line 130).
- `flutter test test/background_sync_test.dart` → **4 passed**.
- `flutter test` (full) → **149 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** — 0 new failures (149 = 148 baseline + 1 new Phase-10 test).
- `flutter analyze` → **33 issues** — identical to the Phase-6 baseline, no new issues.
- `dart format` applied to both touched files.

**Intended commit:** `fix(client): await sync completion in WorkManager task; dispose container`

---

## Working-tree notes (state inherited at Phase 0 start)

The repo has a single commit (`3469c10 initial`) and a heavily modified, uncommitted working
tree inherited from prior sessions. Decisions recorded for auditability:

- **`backend/test_req.py` deleted (out of scope).** It is a manual socket-probe (not a real
  test) that opens a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:8000` on import, which hangs/breaks pytest
  collection so the backend suite cannot run to completion. Per runbook Appendix C this is a
  declared stop condition; removal is the minimal change required for the Phase 0 gate.
  Logged in `FINDINGS_BACKLOG.md`.
- **`backend/server.py` already carries the Phase 1 refactor.** It was applied early (imports
  hoisted, single module-level `haversine_km`, `EnrollmentToken`/`CORG_TABLE` imported at top).
  It is behavior-preserving — the backend baseline above shows 0 new failures vs. the documented
  baseline. Phase 1's gate will be formally re-verified before its commit.
- **Junk scripts deleted** (`backend/tests/fix_*.py`, `bulk_fix.py`, `patch_*.py`): out of
  scope, do not match pytest's `test_*` collection pattern, so they do not affect any gate.
- **Duplicate `New folder/` tree deleted** (a full second copy of the repo): out of scope,
  deleted from disk by a prior session.

## Production Remediation (non-UI) — plan `docs/REMEDIATION_PLAN_NONUI.md`

### P0.a — startup-secret guard: fix the broken guarantee + its test (2026-07-03)

**Problem.** `test_p0_21_hmac_secret::test_server_refuses_to_import_without_hmac_secret`
was failing. Root cause: `server.py` `load_dotenv()` re-reads the developer `.env` (which
contains `DMRV_HMAC_SECRET`) on re-import, silently undoing the test's `monkeypatch.delenv`,
so the "refuse to start without a secret" guard never fired and the test could not observe it.
The guarantee itself was weaker than advertised — any `.env` on the box satisfied it.

**Fix (minimal, non-breaking).**
- `server.py`: wrapped `load_dotenv()` in `_load_env()`, skipped when `DMRV_DISABLE_DOTENV=1`
  so CI/prod/test can assert the guard against a genuinely clean environment.
- `server.py`: introduced a single `_require_secret(name)` choke point for mandatory-secret
  resolution (P2.a will extend it with an entropy/length floor). `_HMAC_SECRET`/`_ADMIN_SECRET`
  remain module-level attributes — no call site or test that reads them changes.
- `tests/test_p0_21_hmac_secret.py`: tests now set `DMRV_DISABLE_DOTENV=1` so a populated
  `.env` on disk cannot mask a deliberately-absent variable; added a sibling test proving the
  `DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET` guard fires through the same choke point.

**Gate (verified).**
- Baseline (before): `1 failed, 12 passed` on the target+adjacent subset — failure was P0-21.
- After: target+adjacent subset `18 passed`; **full backend suite `262 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed`**
  (was 260 passed / 1 failed / 1 skipped; +1 new admin-secret test, previously-failing test fixed,
  zero regressions).
- Pre-existing 12 warnings (async marks on sync fns) unchanged — not introduced here; logged as
  future cleanup.

**Intended commit:** `fix(backend): make startup-secret guard real and testable (P0.a)`

### P0.b — backend CI safety-net gate (2026-07-03)

**Goal.** The gate every later remediation item depends on: run the backend suite on every
PR/push and block on red. Deep analysis first drove two design decisions away from the naive plan.

**Analysis findings.**
- No lint/type/coverage config exists anywhere; `mypy`/`pytest-cov` are not installed.
- `ruff check backend` reports ~100 legacy issues (mostly E402 in tests) → ruff CANNOT be a
  blocking gate today without red-gating the repo.
- `black` is unpinned and broken in the local env (click incompat) → not gated.
- Test deps (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`) ARE in `requirements.txt`; Python is 3.11.9.

**Fix.** `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`:
- `tests` job = BLOCKING: setup-py3.11 + `pip install -r requirements.txt` + `python -m pytest -q`,
  with env vars set to the EXACT `conftest.py` literals (`DMRV_HMAC_SECRET=test-secret`,
  `DMRV_ADMIN_SECRET=test-admin-secret`, …) — a mismatch here fails `test_admin_secret.py`, so this
  is load-bearing, not cosmetic. `DMRV_DISABLE_DOTENV=1` for prod-parity.
- `lint` job = ruff, `continue-on-error: true` (informational until a dedicated ruff-clean pass).
- Deliberately NOT wired: black, mypy, coverage floor — documented in-file and in the plan.

**Gate (verified offline — GH Actions can't run locally).**
- Caught + fixed a real YAML bug: unquoted `DATABASE_URL: sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` — the
  trailing colon parses as a mapping indicator (would have broken the workflow on GitHub too).
  Now quoted.
- `yaml.safe_load` parses `backend-ci.yml` and the existing `codegen.yml` cleanly.
- The exact CI recipe (explicit env + pytest) runs the secret-sensitive subset green: `12 passed`.
- Full suite under identical env values already verified in P0.a: `262 passed, 1 skipped`.

**Follow-up logged:** ruff-clean pass to flip lint blocking; Flutter CI (analyze non-fatal + test);
coverage baseline+floor; Postgres migration lane is P0.c.

**Intended commit:** `ci(backend): add pytest safety-net workflow + informational ruff (P0.b)`

---

## Rainbow T1 — Methodology completion: batch→project linkage + the three dormant gates (2026-07-08)

**Goal.** Make every reason in the C10 compliance catalog *reachable*. Three of nineteen
catalog reasons could never fire: `scale_calibration_expired` and `missing_annual_methane`
(derivers written + unit-tested but NEVER called) and `missing_pah` (called with a hardcoded
`enforced=False` and a literal `pah_measured = False`). Root cause: `Batch` had no
`project_id`/`scale_id`, so recompute could not resolve which scale calibration / annual
verification applied.

**Fix (7 commits, all additive & backward-compatible; legacy unlinked batches stay inert).**
- **T1.1a** (server): nullable `project_id`/`scale_id` on `Batch` + indexes; optional
  `BatchPayload` fields (`min_length=1`); persisted in `create_batch`. Migration
  `f1a2b3c4d5e6` (down_revision `e1f2a3b4c5d6`), reversible. New `test_batch_project_linkage.py`.
- **T1.1c** (client): nullable `projectId`/`scaleId` on `BiomassSourcing`; `schemaVersion`
  22→23 with an `addColumn`-only upgrade block; outbox writer + JSON payload carry them;
  moisture-screen call site stamps `DMRV_PROJECT_ID` (empty→null keeps legacy shape). Codegen
  regenerated. New `migration_v23_project_linkage_test.dart` (asserts `>= 23`, never `== 23`).
- **T1.2**: scale-calibration gate wired in recompute — inert without `scale_id`; validity
  compared in Python (tz-safe on both SQLite and Postgres). 4 new tests.
- **T1.3**: annual-methane gate wired — resolves `(project_id, harvest-year)` verification,
  requires `methane_run_count >= 3`. Year policy = harvest/production vintage (flag to
  methodology owner). Inert without `project_id`.
- **T1.4**: PAH bypass removed — closed-kiln PAH now runs under the default
  `COMPLIANCE_ENFORCED` policy, resolving the same verification row. A source-level regression
  test asserts `enforced=False` never reappears in `server.py`. (T1.3+T1.4 share one recompute
  edit / commit; 11 new tests.)
- **T1.9**: lab biochar-moisture `>= 3` was ALREADY enforced (`min_length=3` on
  `LabResultsRequest`) — added lock-in tests rather than a redundant validator.
- **T1.10**: `/compliance` checklist gains a per-item `enforcement` field
  (`enforced` | `inert_no_linkage` | `awaiting_methodology`) so a verifier distinguishes a
  passed gate from one not applicable to the batch. Additive JSON; original keys preserved.
- **Phase 7 hygiene**: dropped the module-level asyncio mark from the 3 sync transport tests
  (12 pytest warnings → gone); `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED is False` guard untouched.

**Gate (verified).**
- Backend `python -m pytest -q`: **285 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** (262 baseline + 23 new).
- `flutter analyze`: 25 issues, 0 errors (unchanged). `flutter test`: 152 passed, 2 skipped.
- `grep -n "enforced=False" backend/server.py`: no matches.
- Alembic: single head `f1a2b3c4d5e6`; `upgrade head` → `downgrade -1` → `upgrade head` clean.
- Reachability proof: project+scale-linked closed-kiln batch with no calibration/verification
  surfaces `scale_calibration_expired` + `missing_annual_methane` + `missing_pah`; posting an
  in-date calibration and a `methane_run_count=3, pah_measured=true` verification clears them.
- Legacy invariance: unlinked batches produce none of the three reasons (regression green).

**Still OPEN (unchanged — blocked on Rainbow externals / methodology sign-off):** T1.5 transport
factor citation + `TRANSPORT_EVENTS_ENFORCED` flip; T1.6 methane rate → CH4 penalty; T1.7
conversion factor → yield; T1.8 1000-yr inertinite pathway election. Each stays behind a named,
tested, inert flag.

## Rainbow T2 — Adversary-ready security: rate limits, health/secret floor, EXIF honesty, replay, attestation, APK hardening (2026-07-08)

**Goal.** Close the four credit-integrity gaps the audit flagged: unverified device attestation, no rate limiting, replayable signatures, and a debug-signed/unobfuscated Android release — plus two hardening closers.

**Fix (8 commits; all backward-compatible; new enforcement stays behind env switches that default OFF).**
- **T2.2 rate limiting** (`_rate_limit` `@app.middleware("http")`): fixed-window counter keyed by (bucket, device-or-ip); register/admin IP-keyed (brute-force), media/default device-keyed (throughput); 429 + `Retry-After`. Config read LIVE from `os.environ` each request so it survives `importlib.reload(server)` (the CORS test reloads the module) and is runtime-tunable. Disabled by default under test; `test_rate_limit.py` re-enables via `monkeypatch.setenv`. **Deviation from the prompt:** used a middleware matching the existing `_limit_body_size` pattern instead of SlowAPI + 11 handler-signature edits — lower risk against the 296-test suite, no new dependency, codebase-idiomatic.
- **T2.6 health + secret floor**: `/api/health` runs `SELECT 1` and returns 503 when the DB is unreachable; `_require_secret` rejects secrets < 32 chars / < 10 distinct chars unless `DMRV_ALLOW_WEAK_SECRETS=1` (set in conftest + CI so the short fixed literals stay valid). Retargeted `test_p1_25_lifespan` onto the shared `client` fixture (the DB-probing health path hung on the module engine bound to a throwaway event loop).
- **T2.7 EXIF honesty**: extracted `GPS_ANCHOR_MISMATCH_KM` with the trust model stated in-band (client-authored EXIF = weak corroboration; strong control is attestation); `recompute` now records `lca_audit_json.integrity_signals` (mock_location, anchor status, exif_trust) per batch.
- **T2.3 replay protection**: opt-in v2 canonical appends a client `X-Signed-At`; server rejects requests outside an env-tunable skew window (default 300s). v1 still accepted until `DMRV_REQUIRE_CANONICAL_V2=1`. Client `signRequestV2` + the sync loop now send v2 headers. Both sides tested; v1 vectors retained.
- **T2.1 attestation**: new `attestation.py` verifier interface returning a structured verdict; `recompute` routes `hw_attestation` through it; `DMRV_ATTESTATION_ENFORCED=1` makes an unverified batch PROVISIONAL (`attestation_unverified`). Real Play Integrity/DeviceCheck awaits provider credentials (stubs return unverified), so default behavior is unchanged. **Deviation:** skipped the enrollment-nonce column — a reused enrollment nonce is itself replayable; nonce binding will use the per-request T2.3 `signed_at` when creds land.
- **T2.4/T2.5 Android**: `FLAG_SECURE` on release (`!BuildConfig.DEBUG`, `buildFeatures.buildConfig=true`); `minifyEnabled` + `shrinkResources` + `proguard-rules.pro`. **NOT VERIFIED HERE** — a release APK build could not complete in this environment (gradle daemon crash, then 10-min timeout; no R8/keep-rule error surfaced). The R8 build, FLAG_SECURE behavior, and `apksigner` cert check are manual/device gates for CI. Release signing remains debug (T0.6 blocker).
- **T2.8 docs**: secret-rotation, enforcement-switch, and cert-pinning notes in DEPLOYMENT.md + a `TODO(deploy)` breadcrumb in `_require_secret`.

**Gate (verified).**
- Backend `python -m pytest -q`: **307 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** (285 baseline + 22 new across rate-limit/health-secret/integrity/replay/attestation).
- Alembic: single head `f1a2b3c4d5e6` (T2 added no migrations); `upgrade → downgrade -1 → upgrade` clean.
- Rate limit: scripted over-limit register/admin → 429 + `Retry-After`. Replay: v2 request older than skew → 401 `stale_signature`; v1 still works while the require-flag is off. Attestation: fixture verdict + `DMRV_ATTESTATION_ENFORCED=1` → unverified batch provisional; default off → inert.
- flutter analyze: **25 issues, 0 errors** (unchanged — no new issues from the client edits). flutter test: **153 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** (+1 from the v2 `signRequestV2` test).

**Enforcement switches still OFF by design (flip when the fleet/creds are ready):** `DMRV_REQUIRE_CANONICAL_V2` (after fleet ships v2 signing), `DMRV_ATTESTATION_ENFORCED` (after the real Play Integrity/DeviceCheck verifier + credentials). Android release build validation + real release keystore (T0.6) remain the outstanding manual/cross-team items.

## T3.1 — Postgres for real: engine pool tuning + PG CI lane + migration integrity (2026-07-08)

**Goal.** The suite ran only on in-memory SQLite while production is declared Postgres. Add a real Postgres CI lane that runs the suite *and* the migrations, tune the prod engine, and make the migration↔model relationship a checked gate — the "tested on the production dialect" bar T3 requires. ▶ prompt: [docs/ROADMAP/prompts/T3_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md](docs/ROADMAP/prompts/T3_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md).

**Two real Postgres-only bugs the lane immediately surfaced (both latent because nothing is deployed yet, both would have broken the first Postgres boot/flow):**
1. **`alembic/env.py` stripped `+asyncpg` then built an ASYNC engine** (`async_engine_from_config`), handing `create_async_engine` a sync psycopg2 URL → every Postgres migration crashed with *"The asyncio extension requires an async driver."* This same path runs in `init_db()` at app startup, so **the backend could never have booted on Postgres with migrations enabled.** Fix: keep the async driver in the URL (escape `%` for ConfigParser); offline mode still resolves the dialect.
2. **`media_files.batch_uuid` carried a `ForeignKey → batches.batch_uuid`** (only evidence table that did). The field flow uploads a photo *before* its batch exists (deferred anchoring via `_evaluate_anchor`); SQLite silently ignores FKs so this passed, but Postgres raised `ForeignKeyViolationError` and failed **11 media tests**. Fix: drop the FK (model + migration `a2b3c4d5e6f7`, Postgres-only, FK discovered by inspection, reversible `downgrade`); media now matches its five FK-less siblings.

**Fix (this commit).**
- **`db.py`**: pool args (`pool_pre_ping`, `pool_size`, `max_overflow`, env-tunable `DMRV_POOL_SIZE`/`DMRV_POOL_MAX_OVERFLOW`) applied **only** when the URL is `postgresql*` — SQLite/aiosqlite raises `TypeError` on those kwargs, and the suite runs on SQLite.
- **`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`**: new `tests-postgres` job — `postgres:16` service, `alembic upgrade head` → **round-trip** `downgrade base` → `upgrade head` → **`alembic check`** (drift gate) → `pytest`. Migrations RUN here (`DMRV_SKIP_MIGRATIONS=0`), the integrity coverage the repo lacked. The existing SQLite `tests` job is unchanged and stays the fast neutral gate.
- **`tests/conftest.py`**: the `test_engine` fixture now honors a Postgres `DATABASE_URL` (per-test `drop_all`+`create_all` isolation) so the PG lane genuinely exercises app queries on the production dialect — not just migrations. Local/neutral runs keep the fast SQLite tempfile path unchanged.
- **`models.py` / migration `a2b3c4d5e6f7`**: FK drop as above; removed the now-unused `ForeignKey` import.

**Gate (verified LOCALLY against a throwaway `postgres:16` container — CI green is pending-push, T0.1).**
- SQLite `python -m pytest -q`: **307 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** (pool-skip path; baseline held, no regression from the FK drop).
- Postgres full suite (`DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://…`): **307/1/0** — the 11 media failures the FK caused are fixed; previously 296/11.
- Alembic on Postgres: single head `a2b3c4d5e6f7`; clean `upgrade head` → `downgrade base` → `upgrade head`; **`alembic check` → "No new upgrade operations detected"** (zero model↔migration drift).

**Honesty note.** CI cannot actually execute until the repo has a remote (T0.1). Everything above was validated by running the *exact* CI commands locally against real Postgres; the CI lanes are written and locally-equivalent-proven, flipped to truly-green when T0.1 lands.
